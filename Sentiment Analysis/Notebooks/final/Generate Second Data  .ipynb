       "'A television displays a CNN program in a window in Boston, Mass. (Brian Snyder/Reuters)\\n\\nThe hysterical chyrons, the endless drama, Stormy, Stormy, Stormy . . . Better to watch sports or read a book.\\n\\nFull disclosure: I do not watch a lot of cable news. When it comes to politics, I prefer the printed word; what I do watch is largely made up of highlight clips sandwiched into online news stories. Behold, I am a beleaguered cable advertising executive’s worst nightmare! Perhaps I am even a dark portent of an increasingly splintered media future to come.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nI am not, in summary, a huge consumer of televised political theater. Unless I am stuck in an airport. Then I am forced to watch CNN.\\n\\nModern American life is full of mysteries — this week, the hare-brained idea for a television reboot starring well-known unhinged person Roseanne Barr rose chiefly among them. But this Memorial Day weekend, I confronted one of the more vexing puzzles in these United States. It is best phrased in the form of a question, as troubled as it is earnest: Which heartless and devious former CIA torture expert decided that civilians in airports across the country should be force-fed the sometimes-cringeworthy spectacle that is CNN?\\n\\nI do not exaggerate: Over the course of two airports, CNN was everywhere. Before departure, CNN was rolling in our lunch restaurant. Next door, CNN was burbling in a convenience store. In the second airport, in the waiting area at the gate, CNN was not only surrounding me on several screens, but the sound was also piped in.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nEgad! What madness is this? People have books they want to read! People have trashy celebrity magazines they just bought, and they don’t even feel guilty about it, because they’re in an airport! People have smartphones, where they can tune into CNN’s content privately! (Let’s face it: They probably won’t.) Moreover, people are traveling with young children who can read, which makes things rather awkward when CNN decides to run various turgid chyrons about terror and mayhem and the omnipresent Stormy Daniels.\\n\\nIn summary, CNN was everywhere, and unless you had a giant pair of virtual-reality goggles and noise-canceling headphones, there was no escape. In the end, however, there was a quiet upside to all of this: Like it or not, I was helpfully reminded of why CNN’s relative cable news ratings are lower than the cut of a tank top worn by, yes, the omnipresent Stormy Daniels.\\n\\nCNN often pretends to be middle-of-the-road, but it most certainly is not — and perhaps that’s the bulk of the problem.\\n\\nI’m old enough to remember when CNN was taken more seriously, back in the day when the booming voice of James Earl Jones grandly announced “THIS . . . IS CNN.” Today, however, when it comes to the ratings, the supposedly middle-of-the-road CNN wildly trails its openly ideological rivals Fox News and MSNBC. It almost brings to mind the advice found in the Book of Revelation: “Would that you were either cold or hot! So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nI kid, I kid: I just wanted to quote Revelation. Moreover, CNN often pretends to be middle-of-the-road, but it most certainly is not — and perhaps that’s the bulk of the problem.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWitness the now-legendary CNN chyron — that’s the line of headline text gracing the bottom of the screen during every news story — which has taken to reminding viewers, often in cheeky parentheticals, what exactly one should think. Here’s a doozy from February: “WH: TRUMP HAS BEEN TOUGHER ON RUSSIA IN ONE YEAR THAN OBAMA WAS IN EIGHT (NO, HE HASN’T).” On Thursday, in response to a rather fluffy White House–sponsored “Sports and Fitness Day,” CNN got weirdly ponderous: “TRUMP AND FITNESS: AN EXERCISE IN HYPOCRISY?” During my brief yet torturous airport restaurant foray, the network’s chyron read something like — and please forgive my paraphrasing, but I was desperately trying to ignore the TV blaring over my head — “TRUMP FALSELY SLAMS ‘SPYING’ DURING HIS CAMPAIGN (ISN’T HE CRAZY? IT WAS AN ‘INFORMANT,’ NOT A SPY!).”\\n\\nThe good people at CNN can do what they want, but this blatant chyron-splaining sends a rather clear and unfortunate message: that they think their audience is daft and incapable of figuring things out for themselves.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nCNN is frequently breathless when no one should be breathless, which would be kind of exhausting, if anyone cared. Take this headline from the network’s website this week: “The 45 Most Astonishing Lines from Donald Trump’s Nashville Speech.” Brace yourself, for here is just a small sample of those supposedly astonishing lines:\\n\\n“Do we love Tennessee! We love Tennessee!” (Shocking!)\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“I love country music.” (Well, I never!)\\n\\n“This is a big crowd of people.” (Unbelievable! Donald Trump said that? No. It can’t be.)\\n\\n“There they are, right back there. Fake. They are fake. Look how many of them. Oh, boy. That’s a lot of people back there. . . . Fake news.” (Dear heavens! I almost just fell out of my chair!)\\n\\nNo matter what you think about Trump, none of this is “astonishing,” at least not if you’ve been paying attention. What is mildly astonishing is that CNN hosted a guest this week who insisted that every person who voted for Trump — that’s right, every single person! — is a racist. That’s . . . an argument, I suppose.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nCNN certainly has some bright spots of intellect and talent, and let’s be fair: These days, the media world is a brutal business. The news cycle is no longer even a cycle — it’s an endless blur. The push for constant new content is relentless. Endless drama, faux or not, is the nature of the beast; every news network — including Fox News and MSNBC — is guilty.\\n\\nBut only one network haunts us in the airport. Join with me, America, and demand the channel be changed. Or even better, to turn the TVs completely off, with the exception of major sporting events and occasional soothing nature specials. Call me crazy, but it just might work.\\n\\nNOW WATCH: ‘Michael Avenatti Threatens to Sue Reporters’'"

      "Error processing index 6: No candidates were returned for the news passage: Boy Scouts' historic vote on gays: lobbying right up to the end , The Boy Scouts of America may be headed for a historic moment on Thursday . Some 1,400 members from around the country are gathering in Grapevine , Texas , just outside of Dallas , to cast votes on whether to allow openly gay scouts . But even as the largest youth group in the nation , founded 103 years ago , ponders whether to change a policy that some see as an anachronism in a society that is increasingly accepting of homosexuality , the Boy Scouts of America ( BSA ) continues to face criticism from both sides . The proposal to include gays does not include scout leaders . Those who support a more open policy say the proposal does not go far enough , while opponents say the change could ruin a national youth institution by putting too much emphasis on sexuality . Whichever way the ballots go on Thursday , most observers say the iconic boys ’ organization is at a crossroads .\n",

When it comes to politics , I prefer the printed word ; what I do watch is largely made up of highlight clips sandwiched into online news stories . Behold , I am a beleaguered cable advertising executive ’ s worst nightmare ! Perhaps I am even a dark portent of an increasingly splintered media future to come . I am not , in summary , a huge consumer of televised political theater . Unless I am stuck in an airport . Then I am forced to watch CNN .\n",
      "Error processing index 24: No candidates were returned for the news passage: Do charges against Jeffrey Epstein signal 'bigger targets'? , One intriguing aspect of a new criminal case against Jeffrey Epstein is that the matter is assigned to the Public Corruption Unit of the Manhattan U.S. Attorney ’ s Office . As its name implies , that unit typically handles cases involving public officials . Epstein is instead the billionaire money manager who socializes with powerful people such as Donald Trump , Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew . On Monday , federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York ( SDNY ) announced criminal charges against Epstein , alleging that he “ sexually exploited and abused dozens of underage girls ” between 2002 and 2005 . Significantly , the indictment covers conduct occurring not only at Epstein ’ s Manhattan mansion but also at his home in Palm Beach , Florida . The indictment alleges that Epstein worked with several employees and associates to entice girls as young as 14 to come to his homes to perform sex acts in exchange for money . He used some of the girls to recruit other minor victims by paying them , building a “ vast network of underage victims for him to sexually exploit. ” The indictment alleges that he targeted girls who were , “ for various reasons , often particularly vulnerable to exploitation . ” The trafficking count carries a sentence of up to 40 years in federal prison , where parole has been abolished .\n",
      "Error processing index 61: No candidates were returned for the news passage: Trump upset with Sanders over Stormy Daniels response , Washington ( CNN ) President Donald Trump is upset with White House press secretary Sarah Sanders over her responses Wednesday regarding his alleged affair with porn star Stormy Daniels , a source close to the White House tells CNN . Daniels , whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford , filed suit against Trump this week alleging he had n't signed a nondisclosure agreement that would have prevented her from discussing their alleged sexual affair On Wednesday , Sanders told reporters that the arbitration was won `` in the President 's favor . '' The statement is an admission that the nondisclosure agreement exists , and that it directly involves the President . It is the first time the White House has admitted the President was involved in any way with Daniels . `` POTUS is very unhappy , '' the source said . `` Sarah gave the Stormy Daniels storyline steroids yesterday . ''\n",
      "Error processing index 67: No candidates were returned for the news passage: SORRY, AMERICA, BUT TRUMP CAN ACTUALLY WIN , A couple of weeks ago , I wrote a mostly facetious article about six events that could occur to flip the polls in favor of Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton , and then I assessed how much each would matter . No single occurrence , apart from the preposterously unlikely event of Barack Obama endorsing Trump , seemed to have a ton of power on its own . Non-silly scenarios included the release of new and questionable Clinton e-mails , a month of passable behavior from Trump , and a serious health setback for Clinton . What the column failed to consider , however , was the power of a few of these incidents occurring at the same time . We ’ ve now seen new unfavorable e-mail stories ( this was inevitable ) , two weeks of moderately controlled behavior from Trump ( the previous record had been about two days ) , and a genuine health issue for Clinton ( a near-collapse during a 9/11 ceremony ) . We also saw a small but foolish gaffe from the Democratic nominee on Friday night , when she dismissed fully half of Trump ’ s supporters as part of a “ basket of deplorables , ” which she defined as “ the racist , sexist , homophobic , xenophobic , Islamophobic , you name it. ” At a time when Trump should have been further on the defensive , contending with almost comically devastating revelations about his approach to charity ( more on that in a bit ) , he is instead pulling even with his rival . Rumors of Clinton ’ s failing health—which had been easy to write off because they were so obviously orchestrated—have become legitimate concerns . There ’ s no use in discussing Clinton ’ s e-mails here , at least for now . It ’ s not just that there are plenty of other outlets that will further beat that horse—so much so that the Washington Post editorial page has hollered ’ nuff . It ’ s that nothing we ’ ve learned is likely to move anyone ’ s opinion . The general narrative out there , whether that ’ s fair or not , is that Clinton is untrustworthy . The bottom line , in horse-race terms , is this : the drumbeat persists .\n",
      "Error processing index 76: No candidates were returned for the news passage: Baby boomers ruined America: Why blaming millennials is misguided — and annoying , Readers of this post have no doubt seen articles admonishing millennials for their perceived apocalyptic effect on the workforce , society , family and everywhere in between . The seemingly endless list of complaints about millennials begins with lazy and pampered , and ends with “ selfies. ” The accusations , guilt and fear-mongering are unfounded and – even worse – are mostly blame-shifting . Frankly , I am tired of it . What makes the millennial-bashing even more unbearable is the generation that is slinging the mud : the baby boomers . Baby boomers came of age in an era of unprecedented prosperity . They were raised by parents who had survived poverty , war and the true sacrifice of a generation burdened with great moral struggles . As a whole , they experienced economic and physical security . Baby boomers received , by today ’ s standards , inexpensive and widely available education , preparing them for a thriving and open job market . Success at the beginning created a strong foundation for financial and personal success on a level the world had never known . This led to America ’ s greatest asset : the middle class . So what did they do with all their good fortune ? From the time the baby boomers took over , the United States has experienced an economic environment plagued with unfounded asset and real-estate bubbles and collapses . The bubbles were caused by blind greed on the part of investors , and a blind eye on the part of regulators . The baby boomers forced the financial and banking system out of relative security to high-risk systems . The perfect example of this was the 2008 collapse of the toxic housing debt market . In government , baby boomers ballooned the defense budget beyond the point of reason . They then raided government programs to pay for their mistakes . Regarding the environment , baby boomers left the United States reliant on coal ( cough , cough ) while eroding the advanced nuclear energy infrastructure built by their parents . We can thank baby boomer leadership for a nation that has no sound policy on foreign affairs , the environment , energy , social welfare , human rights , terrorism , technology development , education , debt , etc . The point being , baby boomer leadership has provided America with a government that is the most partisan and self-serving the union has ever seen , and remains entirely reactive to the world around it .\n"
