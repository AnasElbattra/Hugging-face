WHY THESE TWO “TOP TIER” GOP CANDIDATES Were Axed From FOX News Presidential Debate,"We can think of two candidates who have no business being on that stage. We d love to know who made this decision They ll be fewer candidates on the main stage at next week s Fox Business Network Republican debate in Milwaukee as both Chris Christie and Mike Huckabee have been told to take their seats at the kids  table.That leaves just eight candidates on the main stage   including frontrunners Donald Trump and Ben Carson, and also Sen. Rand Paul, who many predicted would suffer Christie s undercard debate fate.Next week s undercard debate will again feature four candidates   but with the addition of Christie and Huckabee, that means Lindsey Graham and George Pataki both got pushed out.The debate line-up was announced tonight on Lou Dobbs  show on Fox Business Network.Besides Trump, Carson and Paul, Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, Govs. Jeb Bush and John Kasich and business executive Carly Fiorina round out the line-up.For the undercard debate, Bobby Jindal and Rick Santorum remain in their places on stage.So far only one candidate has managed to climb out of the undercard debates, Fiorina, who spent the August Fox News debate at the kids  table and was hoisted onto the mainstage by CNN, after the network tinkered with its rules.One undercard candidate dropped out, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who was the first candidate to pull the plug on his 2016 ambitions having only appeared at the Fox News undercard debate.Since CNN s September debate in Simi Valley, California, the junior varsity squad has had the same roster: Graham, Santorum, Jindal and Pataki.

 BREAKING: Trump Buildings Go On Lockdown As THOUSANDS Protest Trump’s Electoral Victory (VIDEOS),"Across the nation, thousands of upset American citizens are protesting Donald Trump s victory in the 2016 presidential election. Despite losing the popular vote, the deeply disliked candidate is poised to be the next President of the United States, and people aren t happy. Security teams and barricades have been deployed at various Trump properties as fear of damage escalates. Hundreds of people have gathered outside of his Chicago and New York buildings, and protests are happening in major cities from Oregon to Massechusetts.Dozens of other protests have also happened, centered at universities around the nation.Flags have been reported to be burned during protests in Portland, Oregon, with protestors marching and chanting  fuck Donald Trump!  The Mirror reports that  People also burned an effigy of the President-elect, who will be officially sworn into office in January. As they go on to report, the protests aren t just domestic   hundreds also gathered to protest the American embassy in London, as further evidence of the divide we have driven between us and our allies with this disasterous election.In Chicago, New York, DC, San Francisco, Seattle, Oakland, Philadelphia and elsewhere, live protests are happening right now. Various clips can be seen below.Trump Tower:San Francisco:Protestors chanting:  Racist, sexist, anti-gay, Donald Trump go away  pic.twitter.com/6PQu5waZ0p  Nicole Nguyen (@itsnicolenguyen) November 10, 2016DC:Right now at the Trump Hotel in our Nation s capital.

REVEALED: HOW BARACK OBAMA IS FUNDING The “Resistance” Movement Against President Trump,"Wall Street might be shocked to learn it is helping bankroll the anti-Trump  resistance  movement that s aggressively fighting policies it favors   including corporate tax cuts and the repeal of Obama-era banking and health-care regulations.The payola is potentially earmarked for third-party interest groups approved by the Justice Department and HUD without requiring any proof of how the funds will be spent. Many of the recipients so far are radical leftist organizations who solicited the settlement cash from the administration even though they were not parties to the lawsuits, records show. During the Obama administration, groups committed to  revolutionary social change  sent proposals and met with high-level HUD and Justice Department officials to try to get their pieces of the settlement pie,  Cause of Action Institute vice president Julie Smith told The Post.Some of the chosen beneficiaries are now actively militating against the Trump administration and its policies, including:The Hispanic-rights group strenuously protested the Republican-led  skinny  repeal of the Affordable Care Act after receiving at least $1.5 million from the Obama regime s bank settlement funds, congressional researchers say.La Raza works closely with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and has teamed up with the anti-Trump resistance group, Indivisible, which was co-founded by La Raza alumnus Angel Padilla. Indivisible is working with La Raza and its affiliates to make sure  any bill that punishes sanctuary cities never goes to Trump s desk to become law.  They are encouraging activists to send postcards with pre-printed messages on immigration and health care to moderate GOP senators.NATIONAL URBAN LEAGUEAfter receiving at least $1.2 million from the bank-settlement slush fund, the African-American advocacy group solicited its supporters to oppose efforts to repeal ObamaCare by signing a letter to senators arguing  African-Americans stand to be disproportionately impacted.  It claimed more than 5 million black people would lose coverage under repeal legislation.NATIONAL COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT COALITIONSince hauling in at least $2.6 million in funds under settlement in the Obama-era mortgage suits, the liberal housing-rights group has slammed tax-reform proposals by the Trump administration as unfair, while trying to block efforts to privatize mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, claiming doing so would  deepen the racial wealth gap. NCRC is also actively lobbying against regulatory repeal of many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.The Washington-based group boasts more than 600 member organizations who lobby lawmakers through list-serves, mailings, sign-on letters and conference calls. Though it s assumed that funds distributed to such  qualified organizations  will be used for housing assistance, the bank-settlement agreements do not enforce how the funds are spent. It stands to reason that some of the settlement funds have helped bankroll the resistance  bent on stopping the Trump agenda for America, Competitive Enterprise Institute senior fellow John Berlau said.It s not clear how much money, in all, has been diverted from settlement funds to these and other left-wing organizations. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered a full audit of the funds while discontinuing the practice of funneling Justice Department settlements to third-party groups. Any settlement funds should go first to the victims and then to the American people [through the US Treasury]   not to bankroll third-party special interest groups or the political friends of whoever is in power,  Sessions said in a recent statement.Still, The Post has learned that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau continues to force financial institutions it prosecutes to donate to third-party community organizers. More, penalties in such cases are deposited into the Bureau s now-$170 million-plus Civil Penalty Fund, which has, in turn, channeled almost $30 million to  consumer advocacy  groups.For entire story: NYP ",fake
" STUPID Trump Fans Think He Won The Popular Vote, But He Lost By A HUGE Margin (TWEETS)","As we unfortunately learned during the presidential campaign, Donald Trump s biggest fans love to tell themselves HUGE lies, and then they pass those lies back and forth to each other and actually believe them, no matter how insane those lies happen to be.The biggest one to hit since Election Day is the complete and utter lie that Trump won the popular vote in addition to his electoral college win.

It is now clear that she won it by a margin larger than two candidates who went on to win the presidency.David Leonhardt, a columnist for The New York Times, noted on Friday that with a 1.7-percentage-point popular vote lead over Donald Trump,Clinton will have a larger margin of victory than Richard Nixon had over Hubert Humphrey in 1968 or John F. Kennedy had over Nixon in 1960. (Her edge is also larger than Al Gore s popular vote victory over George W. Bush in 2000, though he too was stymied by an electoral college loss.)In raw numbers, that amounts to an edge of roughly 1.8 million votes as of Saturday.The election is decided by the electoral college, not the popular vote, so Trump will be sworn in to the presidency. But it s telling that even in victory, Trump s supporters must lie to themselves and each other with these completely made up stories. It shows that, despite the claim that the left is in a  bubble  on the coasts, the Trump supporters are the ones who have sealed themselves off from the real world where 2 is always bigger than 1.Featured image via Flickr",fake
 Trump’s National Security Adviser Thinks Obama Was Right About Terrorism All Along,"Donald Trump s new national security adviser thinks former-President Obama was right all along, at least when it comes to his stance on terrorism.HR McMaster, the respected army lieutenant general Trump chose to replace Michael Flynn after he resigned, told White House staff at a meeting on Thursday that he does not want to use the term radical Islamic terrorism.  You know, what Obama has been saying for years.The Guardian reports: A participant, paraphrasing McMaster, said:  He said he doesn t want to call it radical Islamic terrorism because the terrorists are, quote,  un-Islamic . McMaster, the participant said, indicated that the phrase castigates  an entire religion  and  he s not on board .At the meeting, multiple sources said, McMaster discomfited White House staffers who view the terrorist threat in those religious terms and who were said to have exchanged awkward looks with each other.Participants who attended the meeting said they were shocked by how different McMaster s views are from those of Trump, who has dropped the phrase  radical Islamic terrorism  at any chance he got.During the meeting, McMaster also let it be known that he disagrees with Trump on several other points as well. He reportedly  laid out a vigorous defense of the post-second world war liberal order, calling it a guarantor of peace and economic prosperity.  Trump, on the other hand, has attacked these same longstanding foreign-policy goals repeatedly.McMaster also took a stance on Russia that is the polar opposite of his Putin loving boss.  One source said McMaster was  very clear  that he viewed Russia  as an adversary,'  the Guardian reports.Trump chose McMaster as his new national security adviser after Flynn was forced to resign when it was revealed that he had told the Russian ambassador not to worry about sanctions during a phone call that took place before Trump was sworn in.Thanks to Trump s Islamophobic policies, at least one prominent NSC staffer has already resigned. Rumana Ahmed, who worked on strategic communications, stepped down after Trump issued his Muslim ban. She said his  radical Islamic terrorism  rhetoric is really no different from the rhetoric of ISIS.Many who attended the meeting were relieved that McMasters doesn t seem to be a complete crazy person when it comes to foreign policy, but they have no idea how that will  work in context with the rest of the White House .Featured image via video screen capture",fake
 It’s Official: #Brexit Has Made The U.K. As Racist As Donald Trump Has Made Us (TWEETS),"A few days ago, Great Britain voted to walk off a cliff by leaving the European Union, sending the world into a frenzy. Parliament still has to ratify the vote, so it s not a binding resolution (yet), however, it has already had some terrible effects on the U.K. Since the vote, the rate of blatant racism and hate crimes has skyrocketed over there. Brexit turned the U.K. into what we ve become here, thanks to the rise of Donald Trump.What s sad is that, according to The Independent, many of the perpetrators of these crimes cite the  leave  vote as a reason for their crimes, because that totally makes it okay. Yet, the victims of those crimes aren t just immigrants   many of them are people who were born in the U.K., but don t look sufficiently  domestic  for the xenophobic white supremacists that have taken over the country.Sound familiar? It s because we have that problem here, thanks to Trump and his xenophobic, white supremacist followers. Just look at what CBS reporter Sopan Deb goes through while covering His Royal Racist. He s repeatedly asked if he works for ISIS, and is frequently the target of Islamophobic remarks from Trump s loyal fans. He was also assaulted by cops at Trump s cancelled rally in Chicago.Social media is abuzz with this. There s a photo album on Facebook, called Worrying Signs, that contains well over 100 instances of people talking about racist encounters, or witnessing that racism happen to someone else. Below is a sampling of tweets that show what s happening across the pond:Man s t-shirt reads  Welcome to Britain now fit in or f*ck off . Tells me he s got his  country back.

We have people who are just fine with Trump saying that Latinos are  illegals  who are  rapists and killers.  We have a state governor who claimed the rise of drug abuse in his state was due to guys with names like  D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty,  and said that they  impregnate a young white girl before they leave.  He replied to criticism with,  Race is irrelevant. Trump didn t create these problems, his rise just made it okay to be a racist pig in the open, and claim that anyone who s offended is just trying to force  political correctness  on them. And so it is with the U.K., where the Brexit movement made it okay to be openly racist towards immigrants again.We hope these people the ones who spurred this xenophobic outrage by painting anyone who isn t a white, British native as one of their main problems are proud of themselves.Featured image by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images",fake

TRUMP POISED TO REVERSE OBAMA’S Politicized “Global Warming” Policies…Plans To Bring Energy Jobs Back To Americans,"The President who shoved his radical agenda down the throats of Americans is about to watch his legacy unwind in favor of jobs and a stronger economy  President Obama s eight-year effort to rein in the energy and mining industries with environmental regulations will likely come to a halt under President-elect Donald Trump, who is poised to green-light key job-creating projects from the Atlantic Coast to Alaska.With the election of Donald Trump   and a transition team that includes GOP energy lobbyist Mike McKenna and outspoken climate change skeptic Myron Ebell   both sides now see their fortunes reversing amid Trump s promise to rescind Obama s signature Clean Power Plan and jump-start oil, and natural gas projects. I think 80 percent of President Obama s policies will be reversed very soon after Trump moves into the White House,  Robert McNally, the president of the Rapidan Group, the energy consulting firm, and former official in the George W. Bush administration, told FoxNews.com.  The Trump administration will reverse the global warming principles enacted under Obama and he will stop the politicization of infrastructure. This will definitely spur on the growth of the oil and gas industries. Here are three projects that could be revived soon after Trump takes office in January:Keystone XL PipelineOne of the biggest environmental flashpoints of Obama s presidency, the pipeline s final phase   which would create a shorter route for American and Canadian crude oil coming from Alberta to Nebraska   was rejected by Obama for not serving  the national interests of the United States. Keystone XL faced stiff opposition from environmental groups and a minority of U.S. lawmakers amid concerns of oil spills in highly sensitive ecological terrain and worries from the Environmental Protection Agency about large increases in greenhouse gas emissions from Alberta s carbon intensive oil sands.Throughout his campaign Trump vowed to  immediately approve the Keystone XL pipeline    adding he believed it would have no environmental impact and would create hundreds of jobs   and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky is already pressing the president-elect to make it a priority in his first 100 days.If I am elected President I will immediately approve the Keystone XL pipeline. No impact on environment & lots of jobs for U.S.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 18, 2015Reviving CoalCoal production has been on the wane for a number of years as Americans move toward cheaper, cleaner alternatives like natural gas and the industry struggles to cope with tighter environmental regulations imposed by the Obama administration.Saving the coal industry is part of Trump s 100-day action plan and, although he has not given any specifics so far, his campaign trail promises included rescinding the EPA s Clean Power Plan and the Mercury and Air Toxics Rule.Trump s campaign promises of reviving the coal industry helped him win over voters in places like Wyoming, West Virginia and other states hard hit by declining production of the energy source. Now as he readies to enter the White House, many of the voters are looking to see when   and, maybe more importantly, how   the incoming president will fulfill that promise.Trump has not weighed in on the issue, but Sarah Palin   Alaska s former governor who is rumored to be on Trump s short list for Interior Secretary   helped ease the path for what would be one of the world s largest open pit mines by appointing mining industry officials to lead her Department of Natural Resources and embracing resource extraction.Offshore Drilling in the AtlanticThe Obama administration recently moved to restrict drilling in waters off the Eastern Seaboard from 2017 to 2022, but environmentalists, fishermen and those in the East Coast s tourism industry want to make that restriction permanent before Trump comes into office.Despite his vocal stance on U.S. energy independence and support of increased oil and gas development, Trump s stance toward offshore drilling in the Atlantic has been vague   saying only that he backs it when  done responsibly    but if he green-lights drilling in the Atlantic it would make him many friends in U.S. oil and gas companies and could open the possibility to expand drilling other U.S. waters.Obama, however, could prevent this by invoking an obscure section of the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Act that would make it difficult, maybe impossible, for future presidents to reverse the ban. He has used the act before to safeguard parts of Alaska s Bristol Bay and parts of the Arctic. That s the big question,  David Goldston, the director of government affairs at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told FoxNews.com.  Will the Obama administration go beyond the five-year ban? While a permananet ban is still in question, late last week Obama blocked the sale of new oil and gas drilling rights in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas north of Alaska for the next five years   a move that was praised by enviromentalists and largely scorned by oil industry represenatives. Once again, we see the attitude that Washington knows best   an attitude that contributed to last week s election results,  Randall Luthi, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, told The Assocuated Press in reference to Trump s surprise victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton.

 That Time An Ohio Ammosexual 2nd Amendmented Himself In A Chik-Fil-A Bathroom,"Ammosexuals also tend to be anti-gay bigots, so it s no surprise that this particular unfortunate victim of his own love of his penis extension gun would shoot himself in the bathroom of a Chik-fil-A location.While most of us boycott the Christian chicken chain out of sheer principle, but not the 45-year-old victim of his own hubris. He was apparently pulling up his pants in the facilities of the locations (hey, even gun nut heroes have to use the john now and then, right?) when the Glock pistol went off. Luckily for the unnamed miscreant, the bullet only grazed his leg. Hardly a fatal injury, of course, but still quite unfortunate and dangerous.Local station WHOH tweeted the story, but, at this time, there is not much information. The victim was able walk out of the Chik-Fil-A location and transport himself to a local hospital for medical care. The injury is not serious, and, of course, no charges will be filed.BREAKING: Fairfield Twp police and medics say a man accidentally shot himself in the bathroom of the Chick-fil-a. pic.twitter.com/GwXHFz12MI  WMOH Newswire (@WMOHNEWSWIRE) April 28, 2015That s the real rub, though. This guy luckily only shot himself. However, how many incidences have there been of  responsible gun owners  injuring or even killing other people where the law decides that it was just an accident? Too many to count, really. This is just evidence of the fact that we need tighter laws regarding firearm ownership. Not everyone who is eligible to buy, own, and conceal carry a gun should be able to do so.This guy likely was another nutjob who couldn t bear to be anything but fully locked and loaded, even in a public restroom in a self-proclaimed family restaurant, and he was injured as a result. What about next time, though? And, believe me, there will be a next time. No one who is irresponsible enough to have an  accident  like this is a one-off shooter. In fact, if  he were any sort of normal, responsible gun owner, he d have never been pulling his pants up in a Chik-Fil-A bathroom with a fully loaded gun in the first place.Featured image via video screen capture from NY Daily News",fake
TOXIC CULTURE: ‘Suicide (Skank) Squad’ Film,"Jay Dyer 21st Century WireSuicide squad is who they call to counsel the people leaving this vapid movie.  Possibly the worst superhero film yet, it even rivals the likes of Spawn, Catwoman and Ghost Rider.  At least there was Nic Cage, but here, only a confused and garbled CGI wasteland that is as messy as the single mom tats emblazoned every scene.  Nothing in this movie makes sense, much less is the plot even coherent, as a selection of  the worst  of America s convicts are chosen to become Task Force X, a microchipped hit team to take on the  meta-humans  (X-men, yawn) and the extra-dimensional entities that possess two paper-thin characters.Side note   the film is adapted from my old essay, United Skanks of America.This film is one of the few instances I can think of where the overt propaganda is actually more interesting to spot than the film itself.  Will Smiff plays a  hitman  baby-daddy whose only concern is scoring 2 million dollars to buy his daughter s attention.  Yes, all those noble baby-daddies are really just striving for ghetto release so they can become responsible parents.  Next, a hot chick plays a psychiatrist babe-turned skank who, after falling in love with the joke that is  The Joker,  morphs into the average American skank, graffiti ed to the hilt with thug-style sleaze.  In this sense, Harley Quinn makes sense as a representation of the mental illness that plagues the young western female, as evidenced in their body-defacing obsessions and self-mutilation.Planetary sigils adorn the headdress.As Matt Forney writes:No girl has ever improved her looks with a gaudy mural injected under her skin or a piece of metal dangling from her nostrils. There s no man on Earth who has ever thought about his girlfriend or wife, Man, you know what would make her even sexier? A butterfly emblazoned just over her ass. Yet, despite this objective reality, thousands of girls continue to mutilate themselves at an astounding rate, to the point where more girls now have tattoos than men.Indeed, nothing captures the full throttle ruination of the western female than this slut character which drives the ridiculous simulacrum of a plot by seeking to be reunited with Joker Leto.  Since Grant Morrison is an open fan of Crowley, chaos magick and summoning entities through sigils, I am curious which god he offended to have the legions of suck demons inspire his advice to Leto.  That is the only explanation.The Crowleyan elements of this film are really the only noticeable  esoteric  themes, with the Joker now being apparently bi-sexual (perfect embodiment of the ruined western male), and the planetary sigils that adorn Cara Delevingne s headdress.  From here, you can divine the rip off of a rehash semblance a story   a giant garbage vortex  has opened up over a city with the intent of destroying humans who no longer worship the entities as gods.  The giant garbage vortex was actually filmed when in reality it opened up over New York the night this film premiered.Faith, the  Hillary-hero. Originally, the skank squad was formed through the machinations of Reagan (presumably based on the Latin American death squads) and now, even Obama plays a positive role in the storyline from the comic.  Indeed, comic books have long been tools of propaganda, from World War 2 Americanism to Cold War absurdity, comic books have been a staple in the establishment-promoted anti-establishment toxic culture.The sad fact, as I have been arguing for a long damn time now, is that the increase in corporate government control of entertainment realm only results in the degeneration of artistic creativity.   I can wait for the 5th version of the plot of Ghostbusters-Avengers-Ghostbusters-Suicide Squad, but can you?  Aside from this, the other amazing, little-known tidbit is that since the market for comics is generally teenagers, the script was written by a teen   how else would an ancient goddess lithely intone,  You don t have the balls! ?Nowadays, comic books are the tip of the queer spear in promoting transgender  heroes,  fat acceptance heroes that promote Hillary, and the absurd reversing of racial and gender roles (such as Thor becoming a woman and Iron Man a black girl).  The cultural degeneration and toxification is a symbiotic relationship   as the west devolves at lightning speed into a troglodyte, Morlock genetic experiment, the comic book world then comes to reflect that gluttonous, scooter-bedeviled psych ward in its  art. Since comic books now drive the film industry s big blockbuster productions, blockbuster films continue to foist the Disney-Degeneration of social justice warriors rabidly attempting to quell dissent.Meanwhile, the self-devouring ouroboros of the left is its own punishment and destruction.  In sum, don t waste your time, as it s all chaos, and no magic.  However, if you liked John Leguizamo s farting clown in spawn, you ll probably love the ebonics-speaking crocodile in this garbage.The comedy gold of the farting clown.

 This Writer HILARIOUSLY Pranked Trump After Tricking The GOP Candidate Into Following Him (TWEETS),"Hillary Clinton often talks about how Donald Trump can be baited with a tweet, and thus he s ill-suited to be President of the United States because he can t be trusted with his Twitter account, let alone the nuclear codes.One Twitter user just tested this theory, and the results were absolutely hilarious.Eric Curtin, otherwise known as  @dubsteps4dads  on Twitter, is a self-described  writer for things  and to the rest of us, he s a f*cking genius.He recently tweeted out this series of images that shows his brilliant level of trolling.

" White Supremacist Conservatives Cheer ‘Hail Trump, Hail Victory,’ Perform Nazi Salute","The benignly-named National Policy Institute held a meeting on Saturday, where 200 white nationalists and neo-Nazi types gathered to celebrate pushing extreme racism and anti-Semitism back into the mainstream courtesy of Donald Trump s elevation. Richard Spencer, NPI s leader, actually greeted them by shouting,  Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory! And the people cheered while raising their arms in the Nazi salute.Spencer is the person who coined the term  alt-right  to make his fascist movement sound more palatable, but it doesn t change who they are. These are people who share Spencer s dream of an  ethno-state that would be a gathering point for all Europeans,  meaning all white people who aren t Jewish. They re looking to restore purity to the  superior  white race.NPI s agenda for the conference included topics like,  Trump and the New White Voter,   The Future of the Alt-Right,  and  America and the Jewish Consciousness,  and the meeting was more heavily attended this year than it has been in years past. Spencer s opening remarks included: An awakening among everyone has occurred with this Trump election. We re not quite the establishment now, but I think we should start acting like it. Yes. Trump is their Hitler. Pretty much literally at this point.Anybody who doesn t find this terrifying ought to, because pushing Nazi ideology into the mainstream and into Trump s administration brings us way too close to the very thing that Republicans feared the most until this year: Horrific, fascist dictatorship. This isn t the America we re supposed to be.But it s the America that these people want, and, as the Holocaust showed us 80 years ago, people who think this way will do anything to achieve it.Spencer and his racist and anti-Semitic followers believe that the U.S. originally belonged to white Christians only, and they want to push us back there. That means widespread deportation of anyone who isn t  white enough,  and possibly worse. Given that the administration is actually, really discussing a registry for Muslims that could lead to internment, the idea that they can influence Trump against other groups, too, isn t all that far-fetched anymore.And the rise of hate incidents and crimes against anyone who isn t white serves as further evidence that these Nazi-types feel they ve been vindicated because of Trump s election.Haaretz reporter Peter Beinart called these  interesting times  on Twitter, as he watched Spencer spew anti-Semitic and racist rhetoric while waiting to pick up his son at a Jewish school. Interesting? Hardly. Downright frightening is more like it.Featured image via screen capture",fake

when most people think about their eye health  the first thing that comes to mind is whether or not they need to wear glasses although your vision is a major part of your overall eye health there are actually many more things that you need to be concerned about for example there are a staggering  common disorders that can plague your eyes these issues range from cataracts to ocular migraines fortunately there are many natural methods you can utilize to help keep your eyes healthy 
nutrients your eyes need 
there are three nutrients that are known to be critical for maintaining healthy eyes lutein zeaxanthin and mesozeaxanthin each of these nutrients serves as an antioxidant that helps protect your eyes from the damaging effects of free radicals as natural news has pointed out before free radicals are the main basis of all injuries illnesses and deaths 
antioxidants are the only way to fight free radicals so its a good thing that these three nutrients are found naturally in the human eye but what happens when something interrupts this process sadly you can end up with a long list of eye health problems that may even lead to blindness 
instead of merely sitting back and allowing this to happen you can be proactive and start taking supplements the good news is that lutein and zeaxanthin supplements are easy to find research has discovered that most of these supplements also contain mesozeaxanthin although this isnt usually disclosed on the label in fact it sounds likely that this recently discovered eye nutrient is a natural byproduct of lutein and zeaxanthin 
of course this doesnt absolve the supplement companies of their duty to report whether or not mesozeaxanthin is present in their products however their negligence also doesnt reduce the natural reliance that your eyes have on all three of these nutrients in addition to stocking up on these supplements it is also wise to increase your intake of other naturally occurring antioxidants including vitamin e vitamin c and beta carotene 
food sources 
there are many foods that contain antioxidants  carrots are perhaps the most wellknown resource for eye health because they are so rich in beta carotene it would be a mistake to think of carrots as the prime resource though you can also turn to oranges tomatoes sweet potatoes and dark berries for a mixture of necessary vitamins these are some of the best foods for eye health even better you can derive lutein and zeaxanthin directly from food sources such as eggs pistachios corn peppers and kale with enough of these food items in your diet you can avoid the cost of supplements while still keeping your eyes extremely healthy 
additional eye health tips 
if you are a smoker who is also concerned about eye health now is a good time to carefully consider quitting unfortunately people who smoke have an increased risk of developing macular degeneration optic nerve damage and cataracts if you begin abstaining from tobacco products now though your odds of ending up with one of these eye health complications will begin to decline 
other easy steps you can take to protect your eyes include always wearing sunglasses during sunny days and steering clear of computer screens as much as possible if you use a computer for work take a  second vision break every  minutes 
ultimately combining the proper nutrients with easy tips such as wearing sunglasses will help keep your eyes healthy throughout your life if youre currently dealing with issues such as light sensitivity and vision loss you may also be able to naturally regain control of your eye health by using natural vision training and other eye exercises this is definitely a better option than undergoing a surgery that has an extensive list of serious risks and usually leaves patients still needing eyeglasses as usual the natural way is better 
about the author 
jade rich is an lpn and director at an inpatient rehabilitation center as a mother of three children she is always looking for natural ways to keep her kids eyes healthy she knows from experience that another way to do this is by scheduling them for routine eye exams this helps with early detection and prevention its best to schedule this during the backtoschool season during the visit their pediatrician examines their eye alignment and gives a test for visual acuity

Assange: ‘Crazed Clinton Campaign Tried to Hack WikiLeaks’,"SEE ALSO: ON THE QT:  US Election: Behind the Curtain  (PART 1)21st Century Wire says The Democratic Party and the Hillary Clinton campaign have chained themselves to the wild conspiracy theory that Russia is behind the embarrassing Wikileaks email dump and  the Kremlin is trying to interfere with the US election process    even though their is zero evidence to prove that ridiculous claim.Wikileaks has exposed what is arguably the biggest trove of political corruption in US history   but the majority pro-Hillary media are simply ignoring these leaks in order to get behind the media s pre-chosen candidate.So why is the Clinton political machine still panicking? Are we due for another October surprise ?RT Everyday that you publish is a day that you have the initiative in the conflict, Assange said via telephone at a conference in Argentina on Wednesday. The whistleblowing website has been releasing emails from Clinton s campaign chair, John Podesta, on a daily basis since early October.Assange claimed the release  whipped up a crazed hornet s nest atmosphere in the Hillary Clinton campaign  leading them to attack WikiLeaks. They attacked our servers and attempted hacking attacks and there is an amazing ongoing campaign where state documents were put in the UN and British courts to accuse me of being both a Russian spy and a pedophile,  he added.READ MORE: Suspicious US company tried to frame Assange as  pedophile  and Russian spyEcuador s decision to shut down his internet was described by Assange as a  strategic position  so that its  policy of non-intervention can t be misinterpreted by actors in the US and even domestically in Ecuador. ( ) He did, however, reject the idea that WikiLeaks is interfering with the US election, claiming,  this is not the interference of electoral process, this is the definition of electoral process   for media organizations and, in fact, everyone to publish the truth and their opinion about what is occurring. It cannot be a free and informed election unless people are free to inform. He also attacked US TV networks, many of whom he accused of being  controlled by Clinton supporters. ( ) The Podesta emails will make no difference to the election result, according to Assange.  I don t think there s any chance of Donald Trump winning the election, even with the amazing material we are publishing, because most of the media organizations are strongly aligned with Hillary Clinton,  he said Continue this story at RTREAD MORE WIKILEAKS NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Wikileaks Files",fake
 Trump: I Couldn’t Have Divided America Because ‘I’m Not President Yet’ (VIDEO),"Despite having run one of the most disgusting campaigns most of us have ever witnessed, the not-my-president-elect told Matt Lauer of the Today Show that he s not to blame for the division in America. Of course he did. Trump was featured as Time Magazine Person of The Year on the cover Wednesday, which named him  President of the Divided States of America. It is a great honor. It means a lot especially me growing up reading Time Magazine,  Trump told Lauer.  I have been lucky enough to be on the cover many times. Which is an odd statement considering he blasted Time magazine in Dec. 2015 on Twitter when he was not chosen. Lauer was quick to point that out. When you say divided states of America, I didn t divide them,  Trump continued to say.  They re divided now. I think putting divided is snarky, but again, it s divided. I m not president yet. So I didn t do anything to divide. SURE, he didn t. The future Demagogue-In-Chief called his Democratic opponent  Crooked Hillary  at every campaign rally, working the crowd into a frenzy.  Lock her up!  chants commenced at each of his campaign stops. Hate crimes have increased. Every white supremacist group across the board endorsed the acidic alleged billionaire. But he s not a divider. Just ask him.At that point, Lauer grilled him over his use of Twitter, a social site in which he has dished out conspiracy theories to his nearly 17 million followers. I think I am very restrained, and I talk about important things,  he said. That s a modern day form of communication. I get it out much more faster than a press release. I get it out much more honestly than dealing with dishonest reporters,  Trump added.Well, if by restrained he means attacking Saturday Night Live and the cast of the musical Hamilton, then he has a point. Otherwise, he s so full of shit we re going to have to attach a toilet flush to his jaw. As for not being sworn in yet, that s true. But he s the president-elect and needs to put his big boy pants on so he can get to work. It s going to be a loooong four years.Photo by Scott Olson via Getty.",fake
" Trump Voter SHOCKED That He’s Gutting Meals On Wheels, The Rest Of Us Aren’t (VIDEO)","If you haven t heard, the Trump administration is making conservative wet dreams come true by gutting every social program imaginable   including Meals on Wheels, which provides elderly and disabled people with food and occasional company. This development is not shocking to most of us, but 56-year-old Georgia resident Linda Preast somehow had no idea this sort of thing would happen when she voted for a gigantic orange billionaire with a long history of telling the poor to f*ck off.Preast has been wheelchair-bound since she had a stroke two years ago and relies on Meals on Wheels for food. But now that it s not just about building a wall and getting all those damn Muslims out of the country, now that sh*t is getting real, Preast is realizing she may have made a mistake.Are you surprised?  CBS News correspondent Michelle Miller asked Preast about the cuts to the Meals on Wheels program. Yeah,  Preast said.  Because he was told   I was under the influence that he was going to help us. To be clear, there was never any reason to think Donald Trump would help anyone outside his tax bracket. We can t spend money on programs just because they sound good. And Meals on Wheels sounds great,  says White House Budget director Mick Mulvaney, who calls the cuts to Meals on Wheels and other programs designed to help the less fortunate  compassionate. Asked what she would tell Donald Trump to convince him not to cut funding to a program that helps her, Preast replied What if it was your momma? But it s not Donald Trump s  momma  and he doesn t care about the majority of Americans   even his supporters.While the government has decided that a program that feeds 2.4 million people a year  doesn t work,  Americans disagree. Ever since the budget was announced, donations have been pouring in from people who desperately want to save a program that helps so many. The program has seen a 500 percent increase in volunteers and a 50 percent increase in online donations, but it s still not enough. The scary thing about that is that funding is already not keeping up with pace,  Jenny Bertolette, vice president of communications for Meals on Wheels America says.  There are already demands that we can t meet. There is already a waitlist crisis   If this budget was enacted, it would obviously just make matters so much worse.

" Fox News FINALLY Tells Truth About Itself, Then Immediately Falls Back Into Old Pattern Of Lies","Fox News, purveyor of lies branded as  news,  has finally decided to drop the act and tell the world who they really are. In a fairly surprising move, they re dropping their  fair and balanced  slogan. The slogan was Roger Ailes  from the time the network was launched, but it s come under increasing fire for sexual harassment and assault allegations. The slogan is too closely tied to the worst harasser there was there Ailes himself so the network s management decided to drop it.And just when you thought they might actually be doing something right, they twisted reality again to fit their own warped view of themselves. The new slogan will be,  Most Watched. Most Trusted. Sure most trusted by people who don t know what facts are. When Roger Ailes came up with  fair and balanced,  it was because he felt doing right-wing news branded as such was a recipe for failure. That slogan had become the nearly-religious mantra behind their ongoing push of conservative ideology, no matter how outrageous (or, dare we say it, false) the stories were.Fox News has always seemed to be anti-fact because of that, and despite their  fair and balanced  slogan. But  most trusted?  In 2014, they weren t, at least, not among adults who had heard of them or in comparison to other networks, including CNN. However, earlier this year, Rasmussen found that more Fox News viewers trust Fox News than CNN viewers trust CNN.Maybe that s what they mean by  most trusted.  Of course, conservatives are allergic to factual reporting and so of course more of them would see Fox News as trustworthy.As for the  most watched  part? Their ratings have been slipping ever since it came out that there s a serious problem with sexual harassment there. At the end of May, Fox News had fallen to third place behind CNN and MSBNC for prime-time viewership. That was the first time in 17 years that had happened.So  Most Trusted?  Sure, if you re a right-wing nutjob who s allergic to facts, truth and history.  Most Watched?  That s a far more difficult claim to make. Maybe they believe they ll regain their top spot, and there s nothing wrong with believing that. But changing their slogan is probably only a tiny step towards convincing any sane person that they re capable of sticking to truth and facts, particularly with people like Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity still on the air.Featured image via Frederick M.

A YOUNG FATHER EXPLAINS SOCIALISM To His 10 Year Old Son…A MUST Read For Every American,"The discussion Bret Stephens had with his 10 year old son, is one every parent should be having with the very generation who has the most to lose if socialism really is implemented in America. As parents, we re asked countless times by our children to explain ghosts, scary shadows on the walls, or some other imagined childhood fear. How many times however, do our children ask us to explain something that every American should truly fear? How many times do we have the opportunity to explain the reality of Socialism to our children?  We Applaud Bret Stephens of the Wall Street Journal for the brilliant way he explained Socialism to his son. We thank him for sharing it with his readers.Noah, my 10-year-old son, was reading over my shoulder a powerful story about the state of medicine in Venezuela by Nick Casey in Sunday s New York Times. We scrolled through images of filthy operating rooms, broken incubators and desperate patients lying in pools of blood, dying for lack of such basics as antibiotics. Dad, why are the hospitals like this? Socialism. What s socialism? I told him it s an economic system in which the government seizes and runs industries, sets prices for goods, and otherwise dictates what you can and cannot do with your money, and therefore your life. He received my answer with the abstracted interest you d expect if I had been describing atmospheric conditions on Uranus.Here s what I wish I had said: Socialism is a mental poison that leads to human misery of the sort you see in these wrenching pictures.The lesson seems all the more necessary when discredited ideologies are finding new champions in high places. When Venezuelan President Hugo Ch vez died in 2013, an obscure U.K. parliamentarian tweeted,  Thanks Hugo Chavez for showing that the poor matter and wealth can be shared. He made massive contributions to Venezuela & a very wide world. The parliamentarian was Jeremy Corbyn, now leader of the Labour Party.Up north, Naomi Klein, Canada s second-most unpleasant export, treated Ch vez as heroically leading the resistance to the forces of dreaded neoliberalism. Jimmy Carter mourned Ch vez for  his bold assertion of autonomy and independence for Latin American governments and for his formidable communication skills and personal connection with supporters in his country and abroad to whom he gave hope and empowerment. There are lesser names to add to this roll call of dishonor  Michael Moore, Sean Penn but you get the point:  Democratic socialism  had no shortage of prominent Western cheerleaders as it set Venezuela on its road to hyperinflation, hyper-criminality, water shortages, beer shortages, electricity blackouts, political repression and national collapse. Ch vez and his successor, Nicol s Maduro, gained prestige and legitimacy from these paladins of the left. They are complicit in Venezuela s agony.And so to the U.S. election, specifically the resolutely undead presidential candidacy of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. The Sanders campaign is no stranger to accusations that its brand of leftism is cut from the same cloth that produced Chavismo. Yesterday, one of Hillary Clinton s most prominent Super PACs attacked our campaign pretty viciously,  Mr. Sanders complained in September, noting that they  tried to link me to a dead communist dictator. The senator protests too much. As mayor of Burlington, Vt., in the 1980s, he boasted of conducting his own foreign policy, including sister-city relations with Puerto Cabezas in Nicaragua and Yaroslavl in the Soviet Union. On a 1985 trip to Nicaragua, he lavished praise on Daniel Ortega s communist regime Chavismo s older cousin. In terms of health care, in terms of education, in terms of land reform . . . nobody denies they [the Sandinistas] are making significant progress in those areas,  then-Mayor Sanders told one interviewer in 1985.  And I think people understand that and I think the people of Nicaragua, the poor people, respect that. If Mr. Sanders ever rethought or recanted those views, I m not aware of it.But the point isn t what Mr. Sanders may have thought of the Sandinistas in the 1980s or the Chavistas in the past decade. It s that the type of socialism that the senator espouses $18 trillion in additional government spending over the next decade, accusations that Wall Street is a criminal enterprise and the continuous demonization of  millionaires and billionaires is not all that different from its South American cousins.Democratic socialism whether Chavez s or Sanders s is legalized theft in the name of the people against the vilified few. It is a battle against income inequality by means of collective immiseration. It is the subjugation of private enterprise and personal autonomy to government power. Mr. Sanders promises to pursue his aims on the Scandinavian model, as if that was a success, and as if Americans are Scandinavians. It wasn t. We aren t. Bernie s Way paves the same road to serfdom that socialism does everywhere.That s a fact Americans might have learned after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. We didn t. Take the time to tell your kids what socialism is, and does, before they too feel the Bern.Via: Wall Street Journal",fake
 Marco Rubio Just Had The Most Hilarious Reaction To Trump Touching Him (VIDEO),"No one likes to be touched by Donald Trump   not even his own fellow Republicans.On Thursday, the full extent of Trump s repulsiveness was on display when he spoke with Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who was also one of his competitors in the 2016 primaries.Trump was visiting Florida on a tour of the damage left by Hurricane Irma, when he took a moment to commend Rubio, who clearly wasn t having it. Perhaps he remembered how disgusting Trump s behavior was while he was running against him in the primaries, so the look on Rubio s face said it all. When Trump approached and touched his shoulder, Rubio couldn t hold back a grimace and nearly shuddered on camera. You can watch this horrible, cringe-worthy moment below:Watch: While standing next to Marco Rubio, Trump says he hopes Rick Scott runs for Senate https://t.co/9cThL4c0S9  NBC Politics (@NBCPolitics) September 14, 2017Trump was encouraging Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) to run for the Senate seat that is now being occupied by Democratic Senator Bill Nelson. Trump said to the cameras: What do I know? But I hope this man right here, Rick Scott, runs for the Senate. It s unclear if Rubio was wincing because he isn t happy with Trump s choice   after all, Scott previously suggested that his millionaire buddy Carlos Beruff should take Rubio s seat   or because he really doesn t like Trump touching him.Rubio would be far from the only person who doesn t want Trump getting that close to him. Recently, reporter Katy Tur detailed a truly disturbing encounter she had with Trump, which resulted in the POTUS planting an unwanted kiss on her cheek. It has also been widely documented that First Lady Melania Trump winces or looks extremely uncomfortable whenever Trump touches her. It s clear that there s definitely something wrong with Trump s transfer of affection, and it seems to make everyone feel dirty.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",fake
WATCH WHAT HAPPENS WHEN CHRISTIAN MAN ASKS 13 GAY BAKERIES TO MAKE PRO-TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE CAKE [Video]," I was wondering if I could get a cake that says:  Gay marriage is wrong.  The tolerant answers that follow this question show the astounding hypocrisy of the left.Say that  Bestiality Is Wrong  or  Polygamy Is Wrong  and it s not considered hate speech, but if you have the opinion that  Gay Marriage Is Wrong  the whole world jumps up and down screaming  racism   bigotry  and  hatred .This is becoming the politically-correct norm, but no matter what one argues, this is suppressing free speech.No one targeted pro-gay bakeries, but gay activists target Christian bakeries.  Support Gay Marriage  is one Christian bakery was sued for refusing to put that slogan on a cake for an event to support the gay agenda. Yet Christian bakeries that refuse to make pro-homosexual marriage cakes are getting sued left, right, and center. They get fined, they get death threats, and they lose their businesses. This experiment proves beyond doubt that the gay agenda is not just about their freedom to practice a sexual orientation, but the suppression of free speech.To make our case we provided 3 video clips, the third one is a video showing homosexual activists in Ireland used the state to force a Christian bakery to make a cake with the slogan  Support Gay Marriage  for a pro-gay marriage event, but he refused which added a tremendous loss to his business. Several Christian bakeries were sued in the United States with several who lost their businesses and we said enough is enough.So Shoebat.com decided to call some 13 prominent pro-gay bakers in a row. Each one denied us the right to have  Gay Marriage Is Wrong  on a cake and even used deviant insults and obscenities against us. One baker even said all sorts of profanities against Christians and ended the conversation by saying that she will make me a cookie with a large phallus on it.It was all recorded. It will stun the American people as to how militant and intolerant the homosexual bakers were. Even after we completed our experiment we got a ton of hate messages saying that we were  hateful  for simply giving them a taste of their own medicine. They argued that the slogan  Gay Marriage Is Wrong  is not the same thing as  Support Gay Marriage  as if an opposite view of a view is hateful. This would mean that the majority of Americans who oppose gay marriage are  bigoted  and  hate filled .  Support Polygamy  or  Polygamy is Wrong  are views, yet the first which the Muslim supports and the second most Americans would never support, but both are opinions and are considered free speech.Watch what happens when a customer wants to buy a cake for his pro-traditional marriage event:****WARNING****STRONG LANGUAGE ALERT*** Language used by baker to customer on phone is extremely vulgar:https://youtu.be/AJaroR_qTNshttps://youtu.be/ptgAKywiHG0The homosexual activist in this third video said you can t choose who you serve, as though he is taking a purely objective position, but when we ask for the reverse of the same message, all of a sudden the saying of  you can t choose who you serve,  does not apply to us, the Christians.OUR POINTHere is our point. A Christian making a homosexual cake with  Support Gay Marriage  goes against his faith and a homosexual putting  Gay Marriage Is Wrong  goes against his faith as well. Now of course we honor their right to say no, this is not the issue, but what about honoring the Christian right to also say no?CONCLUSIONThe big lie of the homosexual agenda is this: They claim that they are only fighting for equality and tolerance.This is false.What then is their agenda?Via: Christian Patriot ",fake
TOO FUNNY! CHUCK SCHUMER Tries To Lead Liberal Chant… It’s An Epic Fail Just Like His Effort To Block Neil Gorsuch! [Video],"In recent weeks, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) has threatened to lead his caucus in filibustering President Donald Trump s nominee to the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, often citing a rule that a Supreme Court nominee needs a 60-vote supermajority in order to be appointed.The alleged rule has been debunked by fact-checkers, but Schumer is still holding out, arguing that Republicans would be violating the established norms of the Senate if they were to subject Trump s Supreme Court nominee to a simple up or down vote. If Judge Gorsuch fails to earn 60 votes and fails to demonstrate he is mainstream enough to sit on the high court, we should change the nominee not the rules,  Schumer said in a Wednesday press conference. When pressed by Sinclair Broadcast Group, he acknowledged that there was no hard and fast rule subjecting every Supreme Court nominee to approval by a supermajority, but  we believe in a 60-vote threshold. That belief is different from a rule. And Republicans are now arguing that even though the last four nominees to the Supreme Court were forced to overcome the 60-vote threshold for their lifetime appointments, it is not the standard.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said on Wednesday that his Democratic colleagues are invoking a  mythical 60 vote standard that doesn t exist,  because of their 2016 electoral loss.  A 60-vote threshold has never been the standard for a Supreme Court nomination. The 60-vote standard was even debunked by the Washington Post fact-checker two months ago, saying Democrats were using  misleading  and  slippery  language. The claims by Schumer and other leading Democrats earned Two Pinocchios.Via: FOX 57",fake
 Republican Greg Abbott Picks Supporting Israel Over Obama – Plans With Bibi To Antagonize Iran,"Governor Greg Abbott of Texas recently traveled to Israel to kiss the ring of Bibi Netanyahu. While there, he pledged that he will do what he can as Texas  leader to obey Israel s desires and begin working on new ways to re-antagonize Iran.Abbott, like most Republicans, owes his true loyalty to Netanyahu s craving for discord instead of America s effort at peace and cooperation. Abbott pledged to craft laws in Texas to curb the flow of any public funds to Iran. He seeks to accomplish this by banning any state-level investments in Iran or by banning Texas government from doing business with any company that does business in Iran. The second part of that is particularly hypocritical. Republicans have always used terms like  free trade  and the concept of little to no government regulation of business to attack liberals. However, when  free trade  conflicts with the desires of Benjamin Netanyahu   a leader of a foreign nation   there suddenly isn t enough regulation that can be enacted.When asked for an example of how many Texan public dollars flow to Iran, Governor Abbott s office was unable to provide any figures. Without some real data, the impact of Abbott s new laws will be unproven at best, and he would likely have to spend more state money to audit companies to make that determination. Fiscal conservatism at its best Governor Abbott will obviously not be able to single-handedly bring Iran to its knees over new state-level  sanctions,  but the politics on this are clear. Republicans still want to do everything they can to sabotage what is otherwise an incredibly successful and historic win for President Obama on his diplomatic victory with Iran. Being able to show their undying loyalty to a foreign leader in the process is just a nice bonus.Featured image via Flickr",fake
" Tea Party Candidate Wants To Be Elected So Bad, He’ll Betray His Own Party Horrifically To Do It","Art Halvorson, a Tea Partier with a major agenda, is running for office against Rep. Bill Shuster (R-PA), who is the chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Ordinarily, this wouldn t be news, except that Halvorson is literally willing to do anything it takes to beat Shuster. Even if it means running as a Democrat.There s a reason to gag here, because it s like Halvorson is actually willing to infiltrate the Democratic Party in order to accomplish his aims. In fact, the worst kind of Tea Partier is one who will literally do anything, no matter how slimy, to win an election    kind of like Donald Trump. There s a reason the Tea Party is such a problem.A spokesperson for Shuster hit the nail on the head on Halvorson s absolute buttfuckery: By running for Congress as a Democrat after beating the other Democrat by 41 votes in the primary, Art Halvorson has proved that he cares about one thing and one thing only   himself,  said Casey Contres, a campaign spokesman for Shuster.  Not only is he betraying Democrats by calling their party Godless while forcing them to accept him as their nominee, but he is also betraying the will of the Republican primary voters that have twice rejected his attempt to get a job in Congress. He s betraying the will of the Republican primary voters,  that have rejected him. Here s a clue that he s unhinged: Halvorson lost his primary against Shuster, but he doesn t think that s the end of it. That s disgusting right there, because the Tea Party is supposed to be all about the will of the people over tyranny. They want small government, and think the people should hold the power. Does Halvorson think that the primary didn t reflect what the people of Pennsylvania s 9th District somehow? How is this kind of manipulation in keeping with what the Tea Party stands for?Simple answer: It doesn t.Halvorson is sick, like the entire Tea Party.The oddest thing is that he wants to let voters know that he s a Republican running as a Democrat, so they know they need to actually swallow their pride and (gasp!) vote Blue! But he faces a ridiculous battle. Gillian Kratzer, chairwoman of the Blair County Democrats, which is where Halvorson is running, says that Democrats won t be fooled. She believes he should know that Democrats won t support him. Republicans probably won t, either.Halvorson embodies Tea Party desperation at its finest. Many don t see how he ll win, but all that matters to him is himself. Who knew a Tea Partier could be so selfish? Oh wait.Featured image via Art Halvorson s Twitter account",fake
COLLEGE QB Kneed Out Of Anger Over Trump’s Remarks About NFL Players Disrespecting Our Flag…Immediately Gets Bad News From Coach,"He was given the option to kneel in protest before the game, but it was more important for him to take a stand against our President for bravely taking a public stance in defense of our flag and for our veterans A liberal arts college in eastern Pennsylvania cut its backup quarterback after he knelt during the national anthem.Albright College in Reading cut Gyree Durante from its team after he took a knee during the Star-Spangled Banner, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.According to the paper, the school promised consequences if players took actions different than those made in a special agreement.The team s  leadership council  decided that the squad would take a knee during the pregame coin toss, but stand for the national anthem. I knew the consequences. I knew that if I took a knee, that there would be a good chance that I would be kicked off. I didn t like the whole taking a knee during the coin toss, I just thought it defeated the whole purpose of kneeing for the anthem. I get the whole team unity thing, but at the end of the day, I also thought that we should be allowed to be individuals, and express ourselves. The week before, I was watching NFL football, and I happened to see some of the remarks by President Trump about, uh, regarding NFL players taking a knee during the anthem, and he said that they should be fired, they should be kicked off and things like that. I already knew that it was an issue with, all of the racial and social injustice and you know, police brutality among African Americans and things like that.  But when I heard the President say something about it, and, it was very negative, it just kinda struck a nerve with me and it made me think, if this is how the President feels,  then Idefinitelyy need to take a need and protest this.  (Go here for video)After Durante knelt, the Division III Lions went on to lose to Delaware Valley University, from nearby Doylestown, by 41-6.Durante s name was wiped from the team roster and a college spokesperson said in a statement obtained by ESPN that the Norristown, Pa. native was dismissed for his actions.

 Comey’s Old Boss Giuliani Knew About The FBI Letter DAYS Before Its Release; Here’s PROOF (VIDEO),"Something is definitely incredibly suspicious with recently looked at video of former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani knowing about something coming out against Hillary Clinton exactly two days before it happened.Giuliani seemed pretty damn sure of himself while appearing on Fox News on October 26, that there was going to be something released. Giuliani said with a grin a mile wide: I think he s got a surprise or two that you re gonna hear about in the next few days. Then only two days later, FBI Director James Comey came out with his letter to Congress declaring his vague information regarding emails and Hillary Clinton.Keep in mind one very important fact, Giuliani is Comey s old boss, and it sure as hell seems like the former NYC mayor was given some information before anyone else.Not only would this definitely prove the Hatch Act was violated, Giuliani would be part of the violation.According to CNN: Congress passed the Hatch Act in response to concerns that federal employees had been used to support candidates during the 1938 congressional elections. Its general intent is to greatly restrict the ability of most federal employees to engage in political campaign activities (such as soliciting campaign donations or actively working on behalf of individual candidates), especially while on the job   or to otherwise  use [their] official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election. Giuliani is one of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump s top surrogates on the campaign trail, and he seemed to know about something that would directly be harmful to Trump s opponent days before it was released. He clearly knew something.What did he know? And how did he get that information? Is this proof Comey violated the Hatch Act?Watch Don Lemon and Michael Moore discuss how Giuliani seemed to know about the letter before anyone else, as well as the former mayor admit to knowing something:Here it is.

 FL Hearing Goes FULL RACIST: We Must Ban Abortion To Save ‘White Culture’ (VIDEO),"Florida Republicans have sponsored a bill that would literally ban all abortions except in cases where the woman s health and/or life is threatened by the pregnancy. If passed, the bill, HB 865, would make sure any and all abortion providers would spend up to 30 years in prison for defying the law.As if that weren t bad enough, the hearing for the bill featured a horrible racist by the name of Paul, who said that  white culture  was under threat due to legal abortion. The legislators in the chamber allowed this man to go on an absolutely racist rant, in which he said, in part: We see the destruction we re bringing upon ourself as a nation. The Muslims, they don t kill the babies. Paul then went on to say that white people do not live on an island  and  the Mexicans  breed faster because they don t believe in abortions. Then this absolutely crazy man went all in with a mix of nutty religion and disgusting racism: Their race is through the breeding of having families, children. And what happens is once you see the condition we re in, we re destroying ourselves and destroying our families, we ve accepted something in this country that the Creator   that we re going to pay for. You don t see us as a culture, as a white culture, pushing this agenda of abortion, women outside the home not having babies, everybody getting more and more and more? We re a sick nation and if we don t repent then the people leading our government, you are legislating morality by the laws you pass. You are legislating religion and morality by the laws that we pass as a people, and it s destroying us as a nation. After thanking the chamber for letting him speak, Paul reminded them to repent once more: It s either repent or perish America. That s the way it is. The scary part of this is the fact that the bill passed the committee with a whopping 8-3 vote. So, in other words, Florida is about to go back to the desperation of the pre- Roe v. Wade days,when women were dying in back alley chop shops and from self-administered coat hanger abortions.Watch the video of Paul s racist rant on this scary bill below:Featured image via screen capture from Raw Story",fake
 Trump FURIOUS After Federal Judge Stops His Bigoted Muslim Ban In Its Tracks (VIDEO),"Just hours before Donald Trump s new Muslim ban was set to go into effect, a federal judge in Hawaii blocked the executive order. U.S. District Court Judge Derrick Watson ruled on Wednesday afternoon that the travel ban still doesn t still doesn t pass legal muster. The illogic of the Government s contentions is palpable. The notion that one can demonstrate animus toward any group of people only by targeting all of them at once is fundamentally flawed,  Watson wrote. Equally flawed is the notion that the Executive Order cannot be found to have targeted Islam because it applies to all individuals in the six referenced countries,  Watson added.  It is undisputed, using the primary source upon which the Government itself relies, that these six countries have overwhelmingly Muslim populations that range from 90.7% to 99.8%. It would therefore be no paradigmatic leap to conclude that targeting these countries likewise targets Islam,  Watson added.  Certainly, it would be inappropriate to conclude, as the Government does, that it does not. Trump then proceeded to fly into a rage during a campaign rally in Nashville, Tennessee. (Yes, this man is seriously still holding campaign rallies. But I digress.) While speaking, Trump said the ruling was  terrible  and promised to take the case all the way to the Supreme Court if he had to. We re going to take our case as far as it needs to go, including all the way up to the Supreme Court,  Trump said. We re going to win. The danger is clear. The law is clear. The need for my executive order is clear. Obviously fuming over the decision, Trump insisted that Judge Watson ruled against his Muslim ban for  political reasons.  After all, it simply couldn t be because it s based on bigotry. Trump said that this  makes us look weak  when it comes to fighting terrorism.According to Trump, his latest attempt to ban Muslims from the country was tailored to the dictates of the flawed ruling  on his first ban. This is a watered-down version of the first one,  Trump said.  And let me tell you something, I think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way, which is what I wanted to to in the first place. Trump also whined that he couldn t say the things he really wanted to say about the judge s decision to halt his bigoted ban because he would be  criticized. I have to be nice otherwise I ll be criticized for speaking poorly about our courts,  he told the crowd.  Among the most dishonest people in the world, I will be criticized.

3.57 Degrees: Kevin Bacon’s Cultural Mantle Shattered By Zuckerberg,"21st Century Wire says Unless you have been living under a rock for the last 20 years, you would have heard about the cultural meme known as the  Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon , Hollywood s own lowbrow revision derived from John Guare s famous 1990 play about the  Six Degrees of Separation .So popular was Bacon s cultural quirk, that the Gods of Google even launched a web tool called the  Baconator  where users can plug in the name of anyone in order to measure how many degrees of separation there are between you and them.  If I m about to go to work with someone, I ll check their name on the call sheet, and then I ll go to Google, and you can put in their name plus  bacon number,  and that will tell you how many degrees of separation there are. It ll tell [me] if I worked with them,  said Bacon to TV host James Corden recently.Just as the Baconator was getting going, Kevin was usurped, like everyone and everything else, by the ever-engulfing digital vortex known as Facebook and its hoodie-wearing billionaire co-founder Mark Zuckerberg.Poor Kevin. According to new data published by the social networking behemoth, Facebook people are separated by only 3.57 degrees of separation. Casey Williams from the Huff Post explains,  One caveat about this research, though: It applies only to the 1.59 billion people who are active on Facebook. Given that there are more than 7 billion people on the planet, and that over four billion still lack regular access to the Internet, it s unlikely that the new theory holds for humans at large. The down side of course (although Facebook will never publish its trolling data), is that you are also more closely connected with thousands, if not millions of trolls and their phony, malicious sock-puppet accounts too.Even worse, as 21WIRE discovered late last week   Facebook can and will, without any warning whatsoever   and with ZERO human feedback on their end   block and disable your ability to share information with your peers through its user groups. When asked, the reason given by Facebook was simply,  You re going too fast.  No, we re not kidding  Once again, thank you Mr. Zuckerberg for allowing your robots to kill people s ability to share news and information.When they say  degrees of separation    they really mean separation.READ MORE SCI-TECH NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Sci-Tech Files",fake
WHY CHRISTIANS ARE ASKING THEIR FELLOW CHRISTIANS TO WEAR ORANGE TO CHURCH #orangejumpsuit,"It s about time Rev. Patrick Mahoney, of Church on the Hill in Washington, D.C. says that Christians in America cannot afford to be silent about what s going on.Speaking with Fox News on Friday, he discussed the persecution of Christians worldwide. Every five minutes, a Christian dies for their faith around the world. That s over 100,000  a year, he said.Mahoney started the #orangejumpsuit project to raise awareness, encouraging supporters to wear orange in a show of support for Christians being murdered for their faith. The color represents the jumpsuits worn by captives of ISIS, including the 20 Egyptian Copts beheaded in Libya in February.As Christians around the country embrace the campaign by wearing orange to church, Mahoney argued that it is not a strictly Christian movement. Americans need to realize we are seeing a genocide the likes we have not seen in a generation,  he said.And for women, forced into marriages and sold into sex trafficking operations, he said, it is  especially horrifying. Mahoney has been working with religious leaders of many faiths   including Muslims   to be more vocal in condemning the persecutions.He recently stood outside the White House personally wearing an orange jumpsuit bearing the name of Saeed Abedini, an American pastor jailed in Iran.Via: Biz Pac Review",fake
 WATCH: Angelina Jolie BLASTS Donald Trump’s Hate Speech,"Superstar actress and international humanitarian Angelina Jolie spoke out about Donald Trump s hateful speech that is the central premise of his entire presidential campaign. Speaking at an event in London organized by the BBC about the ongoing Syrian migration crisis, Jolie was asked to respond to Trump s comments on Muslims.Trump has said that if elected president he would enact a ban on Muslim migration to the United States and would also consider a program to track Muslims within the country.The very idea repulsed Jolie:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_juLMpLPORw To me, America is built on people from around the world coming together for freedoms, especially freedom of religion. So it s hard to hear this is coming from someone who is pressing to be an American president. Jolie has served for several years as Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Unlike a lot of celebrities who just talk about global issues, she has actually gone to inhospitable areas including war zones, using the intense media spotlight on her to get coverage of humanitarian and social crises.She recently visited Syrian families currently settled in Lebanon, and asked world leaders to step up and do more to help these people who are innocent victims of the ongoing Syrian civil war.When President Obama announced that the United States would pursue strategies to admit more refugees, several Republican leaders panicked. Some in Congress sought to pass legislation barring refugees while some Republican governors announced that they would not allow refugees into their states   but it isn t up to them, and they actually don t have any legal recourse to block refugees from coming in to America.Jolie also addressed this unwarranted fear at her event today as well, noting: Fear of uncontrolled migration has eroded public confidence and the ability of governments and international institutions to control the situation. It has given space to a false air of legitimacy to those who promote politics of fear and separation. Featured image via Twitter",fake

That s exactly what the President did. My question did not suggest he was content with the captivity of those four Americans. My question was about the contentment or the satisfaction or the realization that it was necessary within the context of this deal to leave them unaccounted for. That was the essence of the question.

 Trump In Scotland: Collapse Of The United Kingdom Will Be Great For My Golf Course Actually,"In a twist of fate, Donald Trump happened to be in Scotland on the day the world woke up to learn that in a xenophobic ferver the United Kingdom had voted to disembowel itself by leaving the European Union. Within minutes of votes being counted, global financial markets were sent into complete and total disarray. The Pound Sterling dropped to its lowest value in a century. The UK s Prime Minister David Cameron announced he would be resigning. Countries around the world stopped accepting British monetary exchanges because the markets were too unstable.What did Donald Trump, who hopes to someday soon lead the United States, have to say about this unfolding disaster? He was stoked. He reasoned that his Turnberry golf resort was going to make a killing. I think it s a great thing that happened,  Trump told reporters shortly after his helicopter landed at Trump Turnberry.  People are angry, all over the world. People, they re angry. When the pound goes down, more people are coming to Turnberry, frankly,  Trump added during an afternoon news conference.  For traveling and for other things, I think it very well could turn out to be a positive. To be clear, the pound didn t just go  down    it collapsed.Chart via the Washington PostTrump was not in Scotland for the so-called  brexit  vote, he was there to oversee the opening of a new hotel and golf course. Having unofficially suspended his campaign for the weekend to worry about his golf course profits, Trump was notably over the moon about the UK s self-induced financial collapse. But Trump also seemed irritated that what might be one of the most consequential votes in modern history was ruining his publicity stunt. When reporters pressed him about his feelings towards Brexit, Trump started ignoring the questions entirely and focused on how great the  suites  were at his hotel.But on Twitter, Trump also took the opportunity to prove that he has absolutely no understanding of what the vote was all about anyway. In an effort to  prove  that the world was ripe for right-wing nationalistic takeovers, he tweeted a comment so oblivious that it made international headlines.Just arrived in Scotland. Place is going wild over the vote. They took their country back, just like we will take America back. No games!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 24, 2016Scotland, it was pointed out, uniformly voted to stay in the European Union. The fact that British right-wing nationalists chose to leave is already kickstarting a Scottish independence movement. Very soon, the  United  Kingdom will be neither United nor a Kingdom.

IT BEGINS: KAMIKAZE DRONE Equipped With Bomb To Be Set Off By Remote Detonator Found In Stolen Truck…Could Be Used For Terror Attacks Against U.S. Targets,"This is a truly disturbing discovery and an unimaginable threat that needs to be taken very seriously by our government Mexican police discovered four men carting a kamikaze drone equipped with an IED and a remote detonator last week, in what analysts say is an example of cartels figuring out how to weaponizing UAVs.The disturbing development is a manifestation of something top American security chiefs warned Congress about earlier this year, when they said they feared terrorists would begin to use drones to attack targets within the U.S.Drug cartels had already been turning to drones to smuggle their product into the U.S., and had begun using IEDs in their turf struggles   but now at least cartel appears to have put the two technologies together, according to Mexican reports analyzed by Small Wars Journal. A weaponized drone/unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)/unmanned aerial system (UAS) with a remotely detonated IED allows for a precision strike to take place against an intended target,  Robert Bunker and John P. Sullivan, the authors of the new analysis, wrote.The drone-IED combination was found in central Mexico, by federal police who did a traffic stop on a stolen pickup truck with four men in it.Police found an AK-47, ammunition, phones and what the Small Wars Journal authors said appears to be a 3DR Solo Quadcopter, which retails for about $250 online. Taped to the drone was an IED, which could be trigger by remote detonator.Mr. Bunker and Mr. Sullivan said the  dron bomba,  as they labeled it, was the next step for cartels that have been using papas bombas, or potato bombs   a roughly shaped sphere with a core of explosives and nails and other shrapnel packed inside for the most lethal reach.The analysts said several examples of potato bombs have been detected in Mexico this year.In August, U.S. Border Patrol agents nabbed a $5,000 drone and seized a $46,000 meth load in southern California, after one agent detected it flying overhead. Agents also apprehended the man assigned to pick up the load, who said he had made a number of such pickups and was paid $1,000 each time.Meanwhile, the chiefs of the FBI and National Counterterrorism Center told Congress last month that they are worried Islamic State terrorists who have pioneered weaponized drones in the Middle East will use the tactic inside the U.S. to spread a toxin or drop a grenade.

 Democrat Takes Trump To The Woodshed In Fiery Speech Defending NFL (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is getting absolutely hammered for his recent attacks on NFL players who refuse to stand during the National Anthem in a stand against social injustice.

 Rep. Ted Lieu Issues Blistering Takedown Of Trump’s Illegal Missile Strike (VIDEO),"Anyone who knows anything about the separation of powers understands that a president cannot just unilaterally take military action. He needs approval from Congress to execute an act of war. However, since Donald Trump is president and he seems to think he is somehow above the law, he doesn t bother with silly little details like that. As a result, we got his launching of 59 Tomahawk missiles into a Syrian airfield. It turns out that quite a few people in Congress believe what Trump did to be potentially illegal. One such person is Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA).Rep. Lieu is one of Trump s harshest critics and perhaps his most prolific Twitter troll. When it came to Trump s military action in Syria, Lieu did not mince words. Speaking with MSNBC s Katy Tur, Lieu said: Clearly, the president can take limited actions that the Congress has authorized such as going against terrorists who were involved with 9/11 or in terms of Iraq when Congress authorized the use of force in 2002, but there s been no congressional authorization to launch fifty-nine cruise missiles at a country that has not attacked us. Donald Trump s action last night was unconstitutional. He should not do it again. Rep. Lieu then went on to explain his problems with the launch and the dangers of taking such drastic action with no authorization and no clear strategy, after being asked if he would have authorized this action if he had been given the opportunity to do so: I might have if he would have articulated a strategy, and that is one of my fundamental problems with what he did. There has been no coherent strategy from the Trump administration. Last week, they signaled they were okay with Assad even though he had previously killed hundreds of thousands of people in Syria and used chemical weapons. Last night, they attacked the Assad regime. We need to know what is the Trump administration thinking and what is their long-term strategy in Syria? Rep. Lieu is right. Trump s actions went against the Constitution. He cannot unilaterally make war. Further, he is clearly an erratic, impulsive man. Said erratic, impulsive man now has the power to destroy the world with one temper tantrum. Therefore, more than ever, it is absolutely imperative that Congress use its Article I powers to check and balance this dangerously unstable president.Watch Rep.

" Texas Man Shoots Puppy That Pooped In His Yard, Finds Himself On The Receiving End Of Gunfire (VIDEO)","The NRA tells us that guns make us safer, that a  responsible gun owner  or a  good guy with a gun  will leap into action at the first sign of danger to act as savior. Unfortunately, many gun-toting individuals completely fail to live up to the  gun rights  organization s lofty ideals. The problem is that a  good guy with a gun  is only a  good guy  until he pulls the trigger in a completely unwarranted situation   like in a  spat over dog poop.A Texas man found himself on the receiving end of gunfire after he Stood His Ground when a neighbor s puppy wandered into his yard and relieved itself. Frustrated that the young animal came into his yard, ate his cat s food, and relieved itself, Joe Ramirez grabbed his trusty shotgun and ended its life. In true  responsible gun owner  fashion, he told investigators that he thought the gun was loaded with blanks   but, of course, it contained live ammunition.The dog s owner heard the gunfire and the sound of her pet yelping, so she ran outside to investigate. Another person noticed, as well   her neighbor, who applied a Second Amendment Solution to the situation. When Angela Cruz saw Ramirez standing over the dog and shooting it at close range, she opened fire on him and his roommate, fortunately injuring neither of them.Cruz was arrested on two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Ramirez was charged with cruelty to a non-livestock animal. The dog owner and Ramirez s roommate weere questioned, but were not charged with a crime.Unfortunately, as long as it is easy for quite literally anyone to buy a gun, we will continue to see incidents like this   where popping off shots becomes the first solution rather than an option employed only in self-defense. Ramirez should absolutely be charged   and punished   but think about how different the situation would have been if none of these people had guns.Watch a report on the shootings below:Featured image via screengrab ",fake
ALARM TURNED OFF: Shocking Details on WHITE HOUSE Fence Jumper: “It was even worse than I thought”,"Secret Service personnel removed the alarm sensors along an area of fence line when the agency raised its height in response to previous fence-jumping incidents as a way to make it harder to scale. Ironically, the very effort to prevent fence jumping appears to have permitted a particularly egregious intrusion.One source said superiors in the Uniformed Division told Secret Service personnel to remove the sensors and piece them together for use elsewhere. They were never replaced.There are at least 10 to 12 officers and agents, including supervisors from the Presidential Protective Division, monitoring these sensors at any given time. They do so from the Joint Operations Command Center or JOCC, which is located outside of the White House complex.Some agents and officers also are questioning why Secret Service never released the K-9 unit to try to find an intruder after the alarms on the first fence the intruder scaled went off.Rep. Jason Chaffetz weighs in below on details of what the intruder did in those 17 minutes: The White House fence jumper who lingered on the ground unnoticed for 17 minutes was literally just hanging out in plain view with alarms blaring, and the Secret Service had no clue.Congressman Jason Chaffetz tells TMZ he met with the Director of Homeland Security and the Acting Director of the Secret Service for an hour and a half Tuesday, and his conclusion    It was even worse than I thought. Chaffetz says the surveillance video is shocking   the intruder was not darting around. Rather, he was  lingering,   hanging out  on the grounds. At one point he took the time to bend down and tie his shoes.The intruder at times peered through windows of the building, where Trump was inside. As we previously reported, he also jiggled a doorknob.Chaffetz says some of the alarms failed but some went off, yet the intruder was not detected.Secret Service agents did check the grounds, but not with any urgency. Alarms frequently go off for various reasons, and this time it was met with an inadequate response.And Chaffetz says the video shows agents were simply  lackadaisical.  As he put it,  Everything went wrong.  The congressman says he was promised there would be  big changes,  adding,  There better be. Via: tmz",fake

TUCKER CALLS OUT CLINTON ADVISER: That is a ‘cover up’ [Video],"Tucker Carlson had an intense debate with Clinton adviser and paid spokesliar Richard Goodstein tonight about whether the recent commotion about fired anti-Trump FBI agent Peter Strzok exposes the political double standard at the FBI:(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = 'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.11';  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));Double StandardTucker: the FBI seems to have one standard for Hillary, and one for everyone else.Posted by Tucker Carlson on Monday, December 4, 2017Mediaite reports:The Fox host s A-block tonight gravitated around the news that Robert Mueller removed Strzok from the special counsel investigation after indications showed the FBI agent working with pro-Clinton, anti-Trump leanings. Carlson and Goldstein argued this by comparing Clinton and Flynn s respective lies, and whether the FBI ever tried to lead Clinton into a perjury trap like Carlson insisted that they did with Flynn. There s a double standard,  Carlson insisted.  [Flynn s] name is tarnished for life because he lied in his conversation with FBI agents. Hillary Clinton got a special deal where she was not speaking under oath to FBI agents. Who gets that deal? Goodstein retorted that Carlson was trying to  make something out of nothing,  saying that Clinton would ve been subject to triable charges even if her conversations with the FBI were not held under oath. Carlson went on to accuse Goldstein of  intentionally missing my point  about Strzok s partisanship and redefining the legalities at play in Clinton s investigation. Why in time and again are you saying the FBI refused to respond to Congress when its own integrity is in question,  Carlson asked.  That is a cover-up. ",fake
DIGITAL TYRANNY: Google and Facebook’s Automated Censorship Program (I Hope You Can Speak Chinese),"21st Century Wire says Based on their own reports and public statements, it was clear that both Google and Facebook, and others, were engaged in formulating a wide program of censorship in order to  tackle  what the corporations deem as  offensive speech  or  hate speech . Although based on the political biases of members of these corporations, the actual administration of this will be done by fully hidden and unaccountable automated computer algorithms. According to new reports, the new methods are not merely the manipulation of metrics used to downplay content. These are incredibly clandestine and very sinister measures: without visibly shutting down an account, this new automated censorship process will simply make an account holder s posts invisible to their friends, fans and followers, in what Google/YouTube is calling  a limited state  in order to  isolate and contain  a targeted user   even if they have NOT violated the user terms of services. This is designed not only to  disappear  important opinions and information   but also to frustrate users, in the hopes that they will eventually abandon the platform as a viable content distribution network.We believe that Facebook may also be implementing similar restrictions on political speech. Mark Zuckerberg s admission to Angela Merkel that Facebook was working on eliminating  hate speech  was an early indicator, and undoubtedly the election of Donald Trump, and the subsequent scapegoating of  fake news  by Clinton supporters, has since pushed many  progressive  Silicon Valley executives over the edge. However, things may have advanced considerably since then. On August 5th, 21stCenturyWire.com Editor Patrick Henningsen had his personal Facebook newsfeed for 21WIRE articles  disappeared : UPDATE: Sunday afternoon GMT, it seems that the invisible admins at Facebook has (quietly) re-opened his profile s newsfeed which seems to be visible to some of my friends now, although yesterday s posts are still HIDDEN (you can see them by scrolling down his timeline). They did not respond to Henningsen s written complaint via customer service however   no surprise there, as they never have done before. The important aspect to focus on here is that these secretive measures are all part of a wider political agenda. With Silicon Valley corporations clearly determined to preside over an all-encompassing social media monopoly, such restrictive politicized policies become even more dangerous. The following story which broke yesterday details an apparent backlash from a Google employee against the company s  diversity policies  has gone internally viral at the company. This was reportedly filed by VICE magazine s tech section, Motherboard: The person who wrote the document argued that the representation gap between men and women in software engineering persists because of biological differences between the two sexes, according to public tweets from Google employees. It also said Google should not offer programs for underrepresented racial or gender minorities, according to one of the employees I spoke to. The 10-page Google Doc document was met with derision from a large majority of employees who saw and denounced its contents, according to the employee. But Jaana Dogan, a software engineer at Google, tweeted that some people at the company at least partially agreed with the author; one of our sources said the same. While the document itself contains the thoughts of just one Google employee, the context in which they were shared Google is currently being investigated by the Department of Labor for its gender pay gap and Silicon Valley has been repeatedly exposed as a place that discriminates against women and people of color as well as the private and public response from its workforce are important. See Gizmodo s review of the 10 page Google Doc.Listen to this incredible analysis by Mister Metokur exposing the highly unethical, discriminatory, collusive   and ultimately illegal practices which are being implemented by Google, Facebook, Twitter and other social media cartel platforms in order to erase political speech which they seek to suppress: SUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV",fake
 Beyonce Makes Powerful Statement About Police Shootings: ‘We Are Sick And Tired’ (VIDEO),"If you listen to Republicans, we live in a post-racial society. The fact that we have a black President, they say, proves that there is no racism, and to claim otherwise is racist. Of course, they ignore the unprecedented disrespect the President has had to endure. They also ignore the fact that black people, whether armed or unarmed, guilty or innocent, are far more likely to end up dead at the hands of police. Tired of the shootings, pop star Beyonc  is using her celebrity to speak out on the issue and on Black Lives Matter.The home page of Beyonc s website, which used to be standard for a musician   a list of upcoming tour dates, a promotion of her latest album, etc   now includes this simple but powerful message. She s fed up with the recent rash of police killings of innocent black men. Who can blame her? We are sick and tired of the killings of young men and women in our communities. It is up to us to take a stand and demand that they  stop killing us.  We don t need sympathy. We need everyone to respect our lives. We re going to stand up as a community and fight against anyone who believes that murder or any violent action by those who are sworn to protect us should consistently go unpunished. These robberies of lives make us feel helpless and hopeless but we have to believe that we are fighting for the rights of the next generation, for the next young men and women who believe in good. This is a human fight. No matter your race, gender, or sexual orientation. This is a fight for anyone who feels marginalized, who is struggling for freedom and human rights. This is not a plea to all police officers but toward any human being who fails to value life. The war on people of color and all minorities needs to be over. Fear is not an excuse. Hate will not win. We all have the power to channel our anger and frustration into action. We must use our voices to contact the politicians and legislators in our districts and demand social and judicial changes. While we pray for the families of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, we will also pray for an end to this plague of injustice in our communities. Click in to contact the politicians and legislators in your area. Your voice will be heard.

 President Obama BURNS Canadian Ted Cruz With Epic Joke (VIDEO)," It was a slow burn, but President Obama made the audience explode in laughter with the punchline.During a state dinner in honor of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, President Obama delivered lighthearted remarks that included humorous shots at the Republican Party Primary race and the participants.Obama began by talking about how America and Canada are lands of opportunity and then he turned the birtherism of the GOP around and threw it right back at them in a burn Ted Cruz will feel on the campaign trail. This visit has been a celebration of the values that we share,  Obama began. We as a people are committed to the principles of equality and opportunity. The idea that if you work hard and play by the rules you can make it if you try no matter what the circumstances of your birth in both of our countries. Obama started out serious and thoughtful, setting up those in attendance for what would be a hilarious joke at Ted Cruz s expense, thus once again demonstrating his mastery of comedy. We see this in our current presidential campaign. Where else could a boy born in Calgary run for president of the United States? Here s the video via YouTube.For years, Republicans have claimed that President Obama is illegitimate because they say he wasn t born in the United States even though records clearly prove that President Obama was born in Hawaii to an American mother in 1961.But during this GOP Primary, Ted Cruz has been running for president even though he really was born in a different country, and only Donald Trump has repeatedly pointed that out throughout the race while other Republicans hypocritically remain silent.But President Obama also alluded to Trump in a separate joke, mentioning how Canada is welcoming Americans into their nation if Trump somehow wins the presidency and how our neighbors to the North refuse to build a wall to keep us out in our time of need. Where else would we see a community like Cape Breton, Nova Scotia welcoming Americans if the election does not go their way? And to the great credit of their people, Canadians from British Columbia to New Brunswick have, so far, rejected the idea of building a wall to keep out your southern neighbors. We appreciate that. We can be unruly, I know. President Obama s humor and quick wit will be sorely missed when he leaves office in 2017.Featured image via video screen capture",fake
jewish pirates of the caribbean,"search election law violation was hillarys idea orders to use donald duck to foment violence at trump rallies came straight from the top october   matthew vadum 
democrat hillary clinton personally authorized illegal dirty tricks operations against republican donald trumps campaign according to top democrats appearing in undercover video 
in the third hillaryrelated video released by acorn slayer james okeefe and his project veritas action fund this past sunday oct  clinton is directly implicated in a scheme to use donald duck to mock trump and troll his supporters at trump campaign rallies 
among disney cartoon characters donald duck was a natural choice after all his name used to appear regularly on voter registration documents when bill and hillary clintons favorite community organizing group the nowdefunct acorn hired hobos and felons to go on voterregistration drives 
earlier this year democrats in donald duck costumes started appearing at trump events across america costumed individuals would walk around carrying signs one said trump ducks releasing his tax return 
this cutesy publicity stunt isnt necessarily the problem though the problem is that hillary clinton ordered it and apparently broke the law by coordinating with a taxexempt nonprofit group 
prominent in the video is political organizer robert creamer who is very high up in the democratic partys hierarchy he has reportedly visited the obama white house  times including  meetings with obama personally 
one of the visits took place in obamas personal living quarters 
its a very big deal that creamer visited the presidents residence in the white house a former senior white house employee told frontpage in an interview white house employees can work there for years and never visit the residence 
creamer a practitioner of the agitation arts taught by marxist community organizing guru saul alinsky is husband tof rep jan schakowsky dill a socialist and advocate of singlepayer health care creamer is considered by many to be the legislative architect of obamacare he also wrote a series of bad checks to cover his salary at a nonprofit and went to prison prosecutors wanted to send him up the river for  months but he got off with merely five months and  months of home confinement from a friendly democrat judge 
creamer is a founder of the unsavory political consulting firm democracy partners  the list of partners on the companys website is a whos who of elite democratic party power players 
in addition to creamer the partners are 
midwest academy founder heather booth  website developer marc cerabona  organizer wyatt closs  seiu veteran mac dalessandro  maccabee group founder brett c di resta  crosscurrents foundation cofounder ken grossinger  former media matters for america online organizer david grossman  former seiu national field director for politics john hennelly  strategic communications advisor marilyn katz  organizer jackie kendall  strategist lupe lopez  political consultant mike lux  strategic advisor josie mooney  consultant patrick pannett  organizer christine pelosi her mother is house minority leader nancy pelosi usaction president khalid pitts  former dnc general counsel joe sandler  consultant linda saucedo  fundraiser renee schaeffer  former new organizing institute senior fellow joel silberman  and organizer cheri whiteman  
listed as associates are lauren windsor  executive director of american family voices and aaron black  who appears in the undercover videos black describes himself in the footage as basically deputy rapid response director for the dnc on the ground at trump events adding nobodys supposed to know about me 
frontpage published an article yesterday examining democracy partners 
for a master practitioner of fascistic tactics creamer is amazingly lacking in selfawareness or just plain dishonest he wrote a fatuous ahistorical oped in the huffington post earlier this year titled can fascism triumph in america 
like other fascist movements trump says out loud  and legitimates  the kind of hateful violent language that was previously whispered only in the privacy of peoples living rooms 
bear in mind that quite apart from his mischaracterization of trumps public statements creamer is shown in the videos masterminding an elaborate criminal conspiracy involving the use of targeted political violence against political opponents 
fomenting and carrying out acts of violence against political opponents was what the fascist third reich did using the sturmabteiling or sa also called brown shirts and storm troopers ditto for mussolinis squadristi black shirts maos red guards irans basij  and haitis tonton macoute  
creamer explains the donald duck action in the third video 
in the end it was the candidate hillary clinton the future president of the united states who wanted ducks on the ground creamer says in one of several exchanges so by god we would get ducks on the ground 
creamer makes it clear he knows that this coordination between his consulting firm democracy partners and the campaign was a huge legal landmine when he said dont repeat that to anybody 
the whole duck thing that came about the reason we moved it from dnc to americans united for change was to just do a hopscotch but the actual idea was hatched way back in may creamer associate scott foval said making a pun 
the duck has to be an americans united for change entity creamer said this had to do only with some problem between now acting dnc chief donna brazile and abc which is owned by disney because they were worried about a trademark issue thats why its really silly 
we originally launched this duck because hillary clinton wants the duck in any case so she really wanted this duck figure out there doing stuff so that was fine so we put all these ducks out there and got a lot of coverage and trump taxes and then abcdisney went crazy because they thought our original slogan was donald ducks his taxes releasing his tax returns 
creamer is shown in the video hoping disney would file a lawsuit against democrats for using donald duck in the campaign likely because such a thing would generate publicity 
let them sue us please god he says looking to the heavens and clasping his hands together as if in prayer i doubt they will because were paying to rent or buy the suits thats where they get their license fees were not using it for commercial purposes 
the wall street journal reported aug  that donald ducks was the creation of the democratic national committee then on sept  the paper reported the dnc is no longer associated with the duck  americans united for change is now managing the duck  
but out of public view the dnc and the clinton campaign were still controlling the duck operation breaking federal campaign coordination laws okeefe says in narrating the third video 
we kind of divvy up responsibilities so sometimes it will be like campaign owned said jenna price assistant press secretary at the dnc so sometimes you will see that they advised something or they are taking credit for things so like we arent taking credit for the duck anymore thats like random ally groups but its still something that were involved in 
brad woodhouse president of americans united for change expected the presence of the duck at events would spark violence i think this duck is going to get roughed up somewhere 
in one segment foval says i almost got punched on monday morning i mean i was in a duck costume 
the nations campaign coordination laws were enacted after president richard nixons watergate scandal okeefe notes 
for an activity to violate the law it must meet a threepart test he explains 
first there must be payment by someone other than the candidate for electionrelated activity second a campaign has to be materially involved in shaping communications for a third party group and third electoral advocacy has to take place close to an election 
okeefe continues 
the payment prong of the test is complicated but just the fact that foval a paid employee of americans united for change was the duck at some events constitutes payment by aufc conduct based on their own admission the campaign creamer their agent and aufc coordinated the duck activities and finally content donald ducks is undeniably political content directed against one candidate for the sole purpose of helping another 
the fourth video released yesterday isnt so much an expose of wrongdoing but it does provide ample evidence of creamers ties to the clinton campaign and to president obama himself 
in a phone call creamer says i spend most of my time overseeing the trump events around the country i mean thats what i do for the clinton campaign uh so thats interesting as well 
in another scene when an undercover reporter phones saying he needs an immigration lawyer with powerful connections for a wealthy client in syria creamer makes it clear he is happy to help by reaching out to obamas inner circle 
i just need to i will try and find a couple of good referrals to you and get back to you pretty quick then okay  on the first well ill just talk the guy im going to talk to first to see if this is up his alley the first thing is up his alley its the guy who ran the campaign for president obama he has a firm thats pretty well connected 
in another setting creamer says 
heres what i do for the clinton campaign by the way im a consultant to the clinton campaign wherever trump or pence go in the country we make sure that there are press events in the tv market or whatever  whether theyre big turnouts or little turnouts whatever that drive our message wherever the candidate goes to drive his message so that on any given day they will be between them probably in six places so our team makes sure there are events in all those six places every day so it is a lot of events and we try and help define the other candidate 
every morning i am on a call at  that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters added creamer 
he continued 
im in this campaign mainly to deal with what you know earned media with the television radio with earned media and social media not with paid media not with advertising there would be a whole different advertising  everybody is driven on the same tracks though so then there are a couple a bunch of people in the brooklyn office of the clinton campaign that are responsible for possible aspects of communication like we do rapid response and there is a guy there i work with heavily is the guy that i was just communicating with on that kind of stuff for instance we just found i just sent him a note beforehand when we came here that said my understanding is there might be another revelation of another woman talking about trump this afternoon 
creamer bragged again about his ties to president obama 
oh barack obamas was the best campaign in the history of american politics i mean the second one i mean the first was good too i was a consultant to both the second one was everything hit on every level and every aspect 
obama is a pro creamer said ive known the president since he was a community organizer in chicago 
i was just at an event with him in chicago actually on friday last he is just as good as ever i do a lot of work with the white house on their issues helping to run issue campaigns that they have been involved in i mean for immigration reform for the the health care bill trying to make america more like britain when it comes to gun violence issues 
the second video  released oct  was a primer on how democrats get away with massive voter fraud 
its a very easy thing for republicans to say well theyre bussing people in said scott foval then national field director for americans united for change 
well you know what weve been bussing people in to deal with you fuckin assholes for  years and were not going to stop now  were just going to find a different way to do it so i mean i grew up with that idea they used to bus people out to iowa if we needed people out there wed bus people out to iowa 
in a discussion okeefe described as focusing on bringing people from one state to another state to vote illegally foval who also worked as deputy political director at george sorosfunded people for the american way pfaw explains how to get away with voter fraud 
instead of bussing people in it is better to have them travel in their own personal vehicles he said 
would they charge each individual of voter fraud or are they going to go after the facilitator for conspiracy which they could prove its one thing if all these people drive up in their personal cars if theres a bus involved that changes the dynamic 
its the legality because you can prove conspiracy if theres a bus he said if there are cars its much harder to prove  if theres enough money you have people drive their povs personally owned vehicles or you can have them drive rentals 
foval says its easy to keep the voter fraud operation a secret so you use shells use shell companies 
democrats are untouchable he said the question is whether when you get caught by a reporter does that matter because does it turn into an investigation or not in this case this state the answer is no because they dont have any power to do anything 
foval explained in the first video how proclinton super pacs communicate with each other and how their information finds its way to the dnc presumably a violation of federal law 
i guarandamntee you that the people who run the super pacs all talk to each other and we and a few other people are the hubs of that communication 
were consultants foval says so were not the official entity and so those conversations can be had between consultants who are working for different parts 
he adds 
the thing that we have to watch is making sure there is a double blind between the actual campaign and the actual dnc and what were doing theres a double blind there so they can plausibly deny that they knew anything about it 
the clinton campaign is fully in it veteran leftwing strategist robert creamer confirms on hidden camera hillary knows through the chain of command whats going on 
okeefes group project veritas action fund filed a formal complaint against the clinton campaign with the federal election commission last week 
the complaint states that project veritas 
uncovered a criminal conspiracy where in the words of scott foval the way it works is the hillary for america campaign pays dnc dnc pays democracy partners democracy partners pays the foval group the foval group goes and executes  on the ground this has been done in a manner to evade federal election law and violating coordinated expenditures rules 
the complaint also accuses priorities usa action alliance for retired americans americans united for change and the democratic national committee of accepting prohibited and excessive contributions in the form of coordinated expenditures contrary to federal law and regulations 
the first undercover video okeefe released sent shock waves through the political community 
in that video  released oct  we learned that the frequent outbursts of violence at republican candidate trumps campaign rallies have been orchestrated and paid for by clintons campaign 
the idea was to foment violent at trump rallies in order to create the false impression that his campaign and supporters were violent crazy people and at the same time provide evidence to support the lefts predetermined narrative that the billionaire businessman is a dangerous fascist 
such behavior constitutes terrorism austin bay writes at the observer  
creamer ran what amounts to a domestic us political terror and propaganda operation dedicated to undermining the  us presidential electionrigging the election to use the current term  
the election rigging scheme he commanded relies on street thuggery that means physical fearterroris a core component of americans united for changes crooked enterprise street thuggery is very lowlevel terrorism but it is a type of terrorism nonetheless and it is wrong to call it otherwise hardboy muscle bottles and two by fours are street thuggerys kinetics bottles and baseball bats are not al qaedas high explosivesbut they incite fear and when they crack heads they cause casualties people bleed street thuggery as an arm of politics is violent criminalized politics on an ugly downward slope to much worse the worse including lynchings and pogroms if you dont think street thuggery is terror then consider kristalnacht

White House predicts Republicans will lose new challenge to healthcare law,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Thursday the U.S. Department of Justice was still deciding whether to appeal a court ruling challenging President Barack Obama’s healthcare law, but a spokesman predicted Republicans ultimately would lose the fight. “This suit represents the first time in our nation’s history that Congress has been permitted to sue the executive branch over a disagreement about how to interpret a statute,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest told a briefing. “It’s unfortunate that Republicans have resorted to a taxpayer-funded lawsuit to re-fight a political fight that they keep losing,” he added. “They’ve been losing this fight for six years and they’ll lose it again.” His comments came shortly after a U.S. judge ruled on Thursday in favor of congressional Republicans who challenged the implementation of the healthcare law, arguing that the administration cannot spend funds Congress did not appropriate.

Brazil seeks to revoke asylum of Italian ex-guerrilla convicted of murder,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - The Brazilian government told the Supreme Court on Monday that President Michel Temer has the authority to revoke the asylum status a former left-wing guerrilla convicted of murder in Italy and extradite him at his country s request. Cesare Battisti committed four murders in the 1970s when he belonged to a guerilla group called Armed Proletarians for Communism, according to the Italian government. He escaped from prison in 1981 and lived in France before fleeing to Brazil to avoid being extradited to Italy. Brazil s Supreme Court authorized Battisti s extradition in 2009, but he was not sent back to Italy because former leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva granted him refugee status on his last day in office in 2010. In a note to the top court, the government s chief lawyer Grace Mendon a argued that extradition was a political decision that only the president could make.  She reminded the court that it had approved Battisti s extradition in 2009 and asked the justices to reject a habeas corpus writ issued ten days ago by one of its members. Battisti was arrested on Oct. 4 as he tried to cross the border into Bolivia in a taxi, apparently fearing that Brazil s government was about to revoke his asylum status at Italy s request. He was freed two days later. Lula s refusal to extradite Battisti upset relations between Brazil and Italy. Temer, a center-right president who took office when Lula s handpicked successor, Dilma Rousseff, was impeached last year, decided it was time to remove that thorn.  ",real

Also on Thursday, former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page is scheduled to testify to the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee behind closed doors about his dealings with Russians. Page has repeatedly denied serving as an intermediary between Trump’s campaign and Russia, which had been under U.S. economic sanctions for several years at the time of last year’s election campaign. Monday’s charges were an opening salvo by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, whose investigators are probing allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the election to undermine Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton to help Trump. The inquiry also will determine whether or not there was any coordination between Russians and associates of the Trump campaign. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied meddling and Trump has denied potential collusion between his associates and Russia, calling the investigations a witch hunt. George Papadopoulos, another former member of the Trump campaign’s small foreign policy team, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and will not face trial. A lawyer for Papadopoulos declined comment. Thursday’s hearing will be the first in the courtroom of U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who was appointed by former president Barack Obama and has handled a series of high-profile cases over the past few years. The 2 p.m. (1800 GMT) hearing is expected to focus on setting bail conditions. Manafort and Gates are under house arrest, released on unsecured bonds of $10 million and $5 million, respectively. Manafort, a longtime lobbyist, political consultant and lawyer, and Gates should be given stiff bail terms because of their “history of deceptive and misleading conduct”, their “significant financial resources” and the “potentially significant sentences” they face, prosecutors said in a filing Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. A conviction on conspiracy to launder money alone could carry a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.  Prosecutors also said there was a risk of flight. Manafort holds three U.S. passports and frequently travels abroad. Asked about the information in the filing, Manafort spokesman Jason Maloni said on Wednesday his client “looks forward to having these allegations tried before a judge and jury.” Kevin Downing, Manafort’s lawyer, did not respond to a request for comment ahead of the hearing. It is not clear whether Gates, who was represented by a court-appointed lawyer on Monday, has retained counsel. The charges did not state any direct connections to the Trump campaign or allegations of collusion. Downing said Manafort’s work for the Ukrainians ended in 2014, two years before he joined the Trump campaign in March 2016. Manafort served as campaign manager from June to August. In Tuesday’s court filing, prosecutors said Manafort and Gates had connections to Ukrainian and Russian oligarchs.  Downing said earlier this week that there was no evidence the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government.  ",real
French minister believes banks had 'good reasons' to close National Front accounts,"PARIS (Reuters) - French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Saturday he believed the banks that closed the accounts of far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen and her party had good reasons to do so. But Le Maire also told France Inter radio that he had asked the central Bank of France to look into whether the law had been complied with and that its governor would release his conclusions on Monday. Le Pen earlier this week accused two banks   Societe Generale and HSBC   of launching a  banking fatwa  to silence her National Front party by closing bank accounts belonging to her and her party. The banks said they had acted within regulatory requirements but declined to offer fuller explanations.  If Societe Generale closes the accounts of the National Front, and also I point out that another bank closed the personal account of Marine Le Pen, it s because it had good reasons to do so. I trust French banking institutions,  Le Maire said.  My duty as economy and finance Minister is to verify the law has been complied with. So I asked the Bank of France.... I am convinced that the law has been complied with and that these banks had good reasons to take these decisions.  Le Pen was defeated in this year s presidential election and her party fared poorly in parliamentary elections. She has accused French banks of being politically biased for not lending to her campaigns. ",real
U.S. budget deficit to reach $600 billion in 2016: White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. budget deficit is projected to rise to $600 billion in 2016, $16 billion less than previously expected, the White House Office of Management and Budget said on Friday.

U.S. lawmakers deadlock on Zika virus funds,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers deadlocked over funding to fight the Zika virus on Tuesday, as Senate Democrats blocked a Republican proposal they said fell short of the challenge posed by the mosquito-borne virus and hurt other health priorities. Amid political recriminations by both parties, the Republican plan to provide $1.1 billion in funding to combat Zika, which had already passed the House of Representatives, failed to get the 60 votes needed in the Senate to clear a procedural hurdle. The vote was 52 in favor and 48 against on a mostly party-line vote.  It was unclear when Congress would revisit the issue. Democrats urged bipartisan talks, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said lawmakers would address the matter again sometime after the July 4 national holiday next week. Both sides warned the other that there could be a political price to pay in an election year for stalling on Zika funding, with the summer mosquito season under way and with it the threat of the virus spreading. “Here we are, in an utterly absurd position, playing political games as this public health crisis mounts here in our country,” McConnell said. The Zika virus, which has swept through the Americas and Caribbean since last fall, has been linked to thousands of cases of microcephaly, a rare birth defect, in Brazil, as well as to neurological disorders. It has been declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization. There have not yet been any cases reported of local transmission of the Zika virus in the continental United States, but there have been 820 cases that were acquired from travel to areas with active Zika outbreaks, or through sexual transmission. There have been more than 1,800 cases of Zika infection reported in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory in the Caribbean. Health experts expect local transmission to occur in the continental United States with warmer weather. Democrats have been urging Republicans for months to agree to Zika funding. The Republican plan would have funded mosquito control efforts by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, as well as vaccine research by the National Institutes of Health, and money for community health centers in areas that are experiencing the highest rates of Zika transmission. But Democrats complained that Republicans locked them out of drafting the $1.1 billion funding plan, which would have made $750 million in budget cuts elsewhere. The Republican plan, rushed through the House last week, would have taken money from battling the Ebola virus as well as from funds set aside for implementing the Obamacare health insurance program in U.S. territories. The Senate last month agreed to a bipartisan bill allocating the same amount - $1.1 billion - to fight Zika, but without cutting any other programs. Democrats were especially angry that the Republican proposal that failed on Tuesday would not allow funding to go to private entities such as the women’s healthcare provider Planned Parenthood, although the Zika virus can be sexually transmitted. “I don’t know what universe (McConnell) is living in. What does he think, we’re all stupid, the American people are dumb? They’re not. They understand what’s going here,” Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid declared after the vote. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, had vowed to veto the plan, which falls short of his $1.9 billion request, if it ever arrived on his desk. Republicans charged that the Democrats were blocking the measure mainly because it included no funding for Planned Parenthood, a non-profit group that Democrats and Republicans have been skirmishing over for years. It provides health exams, screening and contraception services to women. Republicans have previously sought to cut off all federal funding to the group, which also provides abortions. Planned Parenthood says abortions make up just three percent of its work. Republican Senator John Thune, referring to Planned Parenthood, charged on Monday that Democrats were more interested in pleasing a what he called a special interest group than in acting on Zika. U.S. health officials have concluded that Zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies. The WHO has said there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can also cause Guillain-Barre, a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults.  ",real
Highlights: The Trump presidency on March 21 at 6:14 p.m. EDT,"(Reuters) - Highlights of the day for U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration on Tuesday: Trump goes to Capitol Hill to warn Republican lawmakers that voters could punish them if they do not approve the plan he favors to dismantle Obamacare, as pressure grows on the businessman-turned-politician to win the first major legislative battle of his presidency. Some conservatives in Washington are angry about a tweak in the Obamacare rollback bill by Republican leaders to delete a provision meant to crack down on illegal immigrants getting federal healthcare insurance coverage. Neil Gorsuch, Trump’s Supreme Court pick, pledges independence from Trump and says no one, including the president, is above the law amid concerns by Democrats that he would be beholden to the man who selected him. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson proposes new dates for a NATO meeting, the State Department says, after he initially decided to skip the talks and rebuffed the alliance’s efforts to reschedule them. Tillerson has written to Senate leaders urging the ratification of Montenegro as NATO’s newest member, saying it is “strongly in the interests of the United States.” The Trump administration is reviewing whether it will reaffirm the goal of a world without nuclear weapons, a White House aide says, referring to an aim embraced by previous presidents and required by a key arms control treaty. The Trump administration is considering sweeping sanctions aimed at cutting North Korea off from the global financial system as part of a review of measures to counter Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile threat, a U.S. official says. A North Korean diplomat says his country has nothing to fear from any U.S. move to broaden sanctions aimed at cutting it off from the global financial system and will pursue “acceleration” of its nuclear and missile programs. The Trump administration confirms it is imposing restrictions on electronic devices carried by travelers coming to the United States from 10 airports, mainly in the Middle East and North Africa, in response to unspecified terrorism threats. Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni wants to send a strong message in favor of free trade when he welcomes Trump and other world leaders in Italy in May for a G7 meeting. Canada’s government, under pressure from domestic steel firms, is expressing concern to U.S. officials about a proposed “Buy America” policy that could cause heavy Canadian job losses, sources say.

"Ted Cruz jeered for refusing to back Trump, exposing Republican rift","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Ted Cruz refused to endorse Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump at the party’s convention on Wednesday, drawing angry jeers from Trump supporters and shattering the facade of party unity that has been carefully built up in Cleveland this week. Anti-Trump Republican delegate Ken Cuccinelli told Reuters he escorted Cruz’s wife, Heidi, off the floor of the Republican National Convention out of concern for her safety following her husband’s speech. For the third day in a row, what was supposed to be a carefully scripted show of unity was thrown into turmoil by unexpected events that have raised questions about whether the party can unite around Trump to defeat the presumptive Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, in the Nov. 8 election.  Cruz, who came in a distant second to Trump in the race for the Republican nomination, stopped short of endorsing Trump after a bitter and personal campaign and mentioned him only once, drawing boos and repeated chants of “We want Trump.” Cuccinelli, a former Virginia attorney general, said: “When the speech ended, there was an ugly crowd behind us.” A witness said one person shouted: “Goldman Sachs” at Heidi Cruz in reference to her employment at the investment bank. Cruz began his speech saying: “I want to congratulate Donald Trump on winning the nomination last night.”  Later in the speech, he urged: “Please, don’t stay home in November. Stand, and speak, and vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution.” Some critics saw the appeal for people to vote their conscience as a vote of no-confidence in Trump. Republican strategist Eric Fehrnstrom, who is not affiliated with any campaign, tweeted: “‘Vote your conscience’ was the rallying cry of the Never Trump movement. For Cruz to bring that message into #RNC hall was a colossal error.” “It’s taken me about 30 minutes to calm down and stop shaking with anger,” said Erik Layton, an alternate delegate from California who had shouted: “Go home” at Cruz after his speech. “I just don’t know why Cruz did this. It baffles my mind.” Trump, 70, a businessman and former reality TV star who has never been elected to public office, made his entrance to the convention hall near the end of Cruz’s speech, applauding Cruz’s remarks but, by his appearance, drawing attention away from his former rival. In a tweet after the convention adjourned for the night, Trump wrote that Cruz broke a promise they both had made to endorse the party’s White House choice. “Wow, Ted Cruz got booed off the stage, didn’t honor the pledge! I saw his speech two hours early but let him speak anyway. No big deal!” Trump wrote. During the campaign for the party’s nomination, Trump insulted Cruz’s wife’s looks and suggested the Texan’s father was with John F. Kennedy’s assassin just before the president was shot in Dallas in 1963.  Cruz, 45, who as a Tea Party conservative in the U.S. Senate angered many mainstream Republicans in Congress and spearheaded tactics that led to a government shutdown over the federal budget, called Trump a “serial philanderer” and a “narcissist” during the campaign. A Cruz adviser who asked to remain anonymous said Cruz anticipated a backlash from the crowd if he did not endorse Trump. “We knew people were going to be mad if he didn’t say the words, but he congratulated him and called for unity behind common values. He expected people to not be thrilled about this,” the adviser said.  Trump won the party’s nomination on Tuesday with 1,725 delegates, followed by Cruz with 475 delegates. Several delegates were outraged by the reaction to Cruz’s speech, saying it could undermine Trump’s support among Republicans who had supported the senator from Texas. “I thought it was shameful,” said Manette Merrill, a Cruz delegate from Washington state, adding she was now confident she would not vote for Trump in November. “They talk about unity ... and then they act like that. That is not going to get us to unify,” she said. The drama did not prevent Trump’s vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, from receiving a raucous welcome inside the convention hall to end the day’s events. Accepting the convention’s nomination, Pence spoke of Trump as a friend of the working class who has persevered in the business world. “He’s a doer in a game usually reserved for talkers,” Pence said. Trump briefly joined Pence on the stage, shook his hand, patted him on the back, gave a thumbs-up and, in a signal to the crowd, pointed at Pence. But the Cruz speech, the latest in a series of disruptions, overshadowed any show of solidarity. Cruz swiftly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter and Facebook immediately following his speech, with about 157 tweets mentioning his official Twitter handle @tedcruz posted every minute. The overall immediate sentiment was slightly more positive than negative, according to social media analytics firm Zoomph. The most mentioned moment on Twitter on Wednesday was the crowd’s reaction to Trump’s arrival at the conclusion of Cruz’s speech. Cruz was also the most mentioned speaker of the night, followed by Pence. Cruz was the most searched speaker on Google. In a speech minutes after Cruz finished, former U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich veered from his prepared text to defend Cruz. “I think you misunderstood one paragraph that Ted Cruz, who is a superb orator, said. And I just want to point it out to you. Ted Cruz said you can vote your conscience for anyone who will uphold the Constitution. In this election, there is only one candidate who will uphold the Constitution,” Gingrich said. “To paraphrase Ted Cruz, if you want to protect the Constitution of the United States, the only possible candidate this fall is the Trump-Pence Republican ticket,” Gingrich said. The convention, due to end on Thursday with Trump’s speech accepting the party’s nomination, has been marked by turmoil from Day One. On Monday, chaos erupted when Trump opponents inside his party stormed out of the room and others chanted to vent frustration over a failed attempt to force a vote in opposition to Trump. On Tuesday, similarities between some phrases in a speech by Trump’s wife, Melania, and a 2008 speech by first lady Michelle Obama triggered accusations of plagiarism, putting the Trump campaign on the defensive. A staff writer for the Trump Organization on Wednesday took responsibility for the “chaos” over the speech. Eminent Republicans such as the party’s previous two presidential nominees, Mitt Romney and Senator John McCain, and members of the Bush family that gave the party its last two presidents have stayed away from Cleveland in a show of displeasure at Trump and his rhetoric against illegal immigration and free trade. Opponents brand Trump a bigot with his calls to temporarily ban the entry of Muslims and to build a border wall with Mexico to keep out illegal immigrants. Underscoring the problems Trump has faced with U.S. allies abroad, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier told Reuters on Wednesday that Trump threatened U.S. and world security with his “politics of fear and isolation.” ",real
Syria producing more energy after army recaptures gas fields - ministry,"DAMASCUS (Reuters) - Syria s government has produced much more power in recent months as the army recaptured natural gas fields from militants, the electricity ministry said on Tuesday.  Bassam Darwish, head of the electricity ministry s planning unit, told Reuters that the amount of gas the petroleum ministry provided to fuel power plants has nearly doubled since last winter.   There had been a very big problem with securing fuel and we went through a difficult winter... We have seen an improvement,  Darwish said.  After the liberation of any area, the workers of the energy sector directly go in and repair facilities.  With the help of Russian air power and Iran-backed militias, the army has driven rebels from Syria s main urban centers in western Syria and marched eastwards against Islamic State. Syrian troops with their allies pushed into the oil-rich province of Deir al-Zor last month, after steady advances against Islamic State insurgents across the central and eastern desert. Several gas fields have fallen back under government control since last year.  Electricity supply has been highly restricted and irregular across various parts of the country during the six-year war. Improving it would help Syrian President Bashar al-Assad restore economic growth in territory the government controls.  Since early in Syria s multi-sided conflict, Damascus and the electricity ministry have worked with friendly states to help keep the power system running, Darwish said.  Contracts were signed with Russia, with China, with Iran... that enabled us to continue working in the past,  he said. Earlier this month, Iran signed deals with Damascus to repair and build power plants, a potentially lucrative move for Tehran that points to its deepening economic role. During the visit by Syria s electricity minister to Tehran, the two sides signed a memorandum of understanding that includes restoring a main control centre for the Syrian power grid. The deals also involve a contract to supply power to Aleppo city.  Darwish said the meeting led to  signing very important contracts  with Iranian energy company MAPNA, with strong support from the Islamic Republic.  Under the deals, Iran will make payment easy for the Syrian government, whose economy has been battered by war and Western sanctions, he said.   The contracts...are based on payment facilities from the Iranian side,  he added.  We expect very big contracts to come out of the MoU that was signed... very large numbers, always with preferential terms for the Syrian side.  Shunned by Western powers, Damascus has been looking to friendly states to play a major role in rebuilding the country.  Iran will build an oil refinery in Syria after the war ends, the head of downstream technologies at Iran s Research Institute of the Petroleum Industry was quoted as saying on Tuesday.   In January, Iran s government and entities close to its elite Revolutionary Guards signed major telecommunications and mining deals with Damascus. Since at least 2012, Iran has provided critical military support to the Damascus government, helping it regain swathes of the country. Iran experts say Tehran is now looking to reap a financial dividend. Before the war in Syria,  power cuts and blackouts were almost non-existent,  Darwish said. The government produced less than 20 billion kilowatt hour last year, down from 50 billion in 2011, he said.   It was constantly declining because of the lack of fuel,  in addition to destruction in the electric system and energy sector, including power plants and oil wells, he said. Darwish estimated that direct damages in the power sector throughout the war amounted to between $4 and 5 billion. Indirect losses resulting from the lack of electricity to various sectors, residential zones, and institutions, had reached nearly $60 billion, he said.  This shows us...the scale of the efforts that will have to be very big to restore the electric system,  which will also require very large investments, he said.   This issue is related to the availability of funding, which is currently the main obstacle,  he said. The government was doing all it could,  but the size of the damages is big.  ",real

U.S. lawmakers say Trump administration still lacks clear North Korea plan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers said high-profile briefings by the Trump administration on North Korea on Wednesday failed to provide the firm strategy they had hoped for dealing with what they described as a major national security threat. As a standoff escalated over the reclusive Asian nation’s development of nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles, President Donald Trump welcomed all 100 members of the Senate to a highly unusual meeting at the White House complex, with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. While administration officials often travel to the Capitol to brief lawmakers on national security issues, this time the entire Senate hopped on buses to the White House. Vice President Mike Pence and the four officials later briefed the House of Representatives. That classified meeting took place in a secure auditorium at the Capitol complex. The briefings came as Trump tries to put the best face on his first 100 days in office. He has signed executive orders to roll back Democratic policies but the period has been defined by an absence of any major legislative achievements. A few Democrats dismissed the Senate White House “field trip” as little more than a photo opportunity.  Some Republicans were a little more enthusiastic. “It was an OK briefing,” Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters as he arrived back at the Senate. “I’m not certain I would have had the briefing today,” he said. Asked if the administration had a firm strategy, Senator John McCain, who chairs the Armed Services Committee, said, “They’re developing one.” This week, Trump has discussed North Korea with U.N. ambassadors, increased the U.S. military presence in the region, and leaned on China to pressure Pyongyang. Tillerson will chair a U.N. Security Council meeting on Friday to discuss tougher sanctions. After their briefing, members of the House expressed confidence in the administration officials who spoke, but some said they had real concerns. Representative Brad Sherman, a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he was not convinced that the administration would do enough to control Pyongyang. “I regard that level of resolve as very modest, weak and maybe even phony. The only way to put enough pressure on North Korea is to get China to do it,” Sherman told reporters. Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said the administration wants to use “a variety” of tactics to push North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions and said he agreed that all options must be on the table. “We have to have incredible military presence in the region, including missile defense, especially for this regime,” he said.

Ethics review sought after Trump adviser touts Ivanka Trump products,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - (This February 9 story has been refiled to correct paragraph 19 to show HSN Inc has dropped Trump Home products, but still sells Trump presidential memorabilia; it did not sell Ivanka Trump products.) A congressional committee said on Thursday it was seeking a review into whether senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway had violated ethics rules by using her position to promote product lines of President Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka, a day after he attacked a retailer for dropping them. Federal ethics rules prohibit executive branch employees from using their positions to endorse products or for the private gain of friends. The law does not apply to the president.    “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff ... I’m going to go get some myself today,” Conway told Fox News in an interview from the White House. “I’m going to give a free commercial here: Go buy it today, everybody.” Republican Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House of Representatives Oversight committee, said late on Thursday in a statement he had agreed to a request by a member of the panel to ask the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) to review Conway’s comments and recommend disciplinary action against her if warranted. Chaffetz and Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the committee, said in their letter to the ethics office: “Conway’s statements appear to violate federal ethics regulations, which prohibit actions that imply a government endorsement of the ‘personal activities’ of another person.”  “In this case, there is an additional challenge, which is that the president, as the ultimate disciplinary authority for White House employees, has an inherent conflict of interest since Conway’s statements relate to his daughter’s private business,” they said. The OGE did not respond to requests for comment.        Asked at a press briefing on Thursday if Conway had crossed an ethical line, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said, “She has been counseled on that subject, and that’s it.” Conway, asked in an interview on Fox News on Thursday evening how she had been counseled, replied: “I’m not going to comment on that.”       She said she was aware of the letter from Chaffetz and Cummings and that it was being reviewed internally. “I’m just really happy that I spent an awful lot of time with the president of the United States this afternoon and that he supports me 100 percent,” she added. The non-profit Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and Public Citizen have both filed complaints with the OGE and the White House Counsel’s Office. “It’s a violation of the rule,” Norman Eisen, who served as an ethics adviser to Democratic President Barack Obama, told MSNBC. “It’s a serious matter.” On Wednesday, President Trump attacked department store chain Nordstrom Inc for dropping his daughter’s products, drawing intense criticism for using a White House twitter platform to intervene in a commercial matter involving his family’s business ties.  Nordstrom said it dropped the brand for its poor performance. Online sales of Ivanka Trump branded products fell 26 percent in January 2017 compared with the same period a year earlier, according to retail analytics firm Slice Intelligence which shared its findings with Reuters. The company analyzed data from email receipts of over 4 million U.S. online shoppers. The data also showed sales of the Ivanka Trump brand declined in the second half of 2016 at all online retailers including Amazon.com Inc, which sells most of the brand’s merchandise. In-store sales of the Ivanka Trump brand was not available.  Ivanka Trump had said she would step away from her company when her father took office in the White House.  Retailers that have dropped Ivanka Trump products include Neiman Marcus [NMRCUS.UL]. HSN Inc has stopped selling Trump Home products, but still sells Trump presidential memorabilia. An ongoing campaign called #GrabYourWallet encourages shoppers to boycott products with ties to President Trump and his family. Supporters have launched an alternative social media campaign called #BuyIvanka. President Trump has pledged to ensure that products sold in America are actually manufactured on U.S. soil, but a New York Times report in December found that many of Ivanka Trump branded products were made in China, Indonesia and Vietnam. Ivanka Trump’s company declined to comment where her goods were manufactured. ",real

"Pence warns North Korea of U.S. resolve shown in Syria, Afghan strikes","SEOUL/PYONGYANG (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence warned North Korea on Monday that recent American military strikes in Syria and Afghanistan showed President Donald Trump’s resolve should not be questioned, but Pyongyang vowed to continue missile and nuclear tests. After a huge display of missiles in Pyongyang and a failed North Korean missile test during the weekend, U.S. officials praised China for stepping up efforts to rein in North Korea, Beijing’s neighbor and ally. But Pence and South Korea’s acting president, Hwang Kyo-ahn, said they would proceed with the early deployment to South Korea of the U.S. THAAD missile-defense system, in spite of Chinese objections. At a White House Easter celebration on Monday, Trump was asked if he had a message for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and replied: “Gotta behave.” But senior North Korean officials remained defiant. North Korea’s deputy representative to the United Nations, Kim In Ryong, accused Washington of creating “a situation where nuclear war could break out an any time” and said Pyongyang’s next nuclear test would take place “at a time and at a place where our headquarters deems necessary.” (Graphic - Carl Vinson strike group: tmsnrt.rs/2pqOMWA) (Graphic - North Korea's nuclear program: tmsnrt.rs/2n0gd92) North Korea’s Vice Foreign Minister Han Song-Ryol told the BBC that missiles would continue to be tested on “a weekly, monthly and yearly basis.”  Kim Song Gyong, director general of the European Department of North Korea’s Foreign Ministry, told Reuters in Pyongyang that if Washington made “the slightest movement” to make a nuclear strike on North Korea, Pyongyang would strike first and “destroy the aggressors without any mercy.” He went on to clarify that the approach of a U.S. naval strike force led by the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Carl Vinson to Korean waters would not be considered enough to constitute “the slightest movement”. Korean tensions have escalated following repeated North Korean missile tests and concerns that Pyongyang may soon conduct a sixth nuclear bomb test in defiance of U.N. sanctions. Washington is increasingly worried about North Korean efforts to develop a nuclear-tipped missile that could hit the U.S. mainland. Speaking alongside Hwang, Pence said the world had witnessed Trump’s resolve in the past two weeks, which saw a U.S. missile attack on a Syrian airfield and the dropping of a powerful non-nuclear bomb on Islamic State in Afghanistan. “North Korea would do well not to test his resolve or the strength of the armed forces of the United States in this region,” Pence said on what was his first stop of a four-nation Asia tour intended to show that Trump is not turning his back on the increasingly volatile part of the world. Pence, whose father served in the 1950-53 Korean War, visited the North-South border on Monday and said Washington would stand by its “ironclad alliance” with South Korea. “All options are on the table to achieve the objectives and ensure the stability of the people of this country,” he told reporters as tinny propaganda music floated across from the North Korean side of the so-called demilitarized zone (DMZ). The Trump administration has said that military action remains an option for dealing with North Korea. But mindful that this would likely trigger massive retaliation and casualties in South Korea and Japan and among U.S. troops there, U.S. officials say the Trump administration’s main focus is on tougher economic sanctions to try to get Pyongyang to abandon its weapons programs.    Trump himself, when asked on Monday if he was considering military action, told Fox News Channel he didn’t want to “telegraph” his plans like the previous administration. “We’ll see what happens. I hope things work out well,” he said but added that the United States had tried to engage the North Koreans in talks for a long time.  On Sunday, Trump’s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, said that the United States, its allies and China were working on a range of responses to North Korea’s latest missile test, citing what he called an international consensus to act. He indicated Trump was not considering military action for now, despite the dispatch the carrier group. U.S. officials say tougher sanctions could include an oil embargo, a global ban on North Korea’s airline, intercepting cargo ships and punishing Chinese banks doing business with Pyongyang. They say greater Chinese cooperation is vital.  White House spokesman Sean Spicer said China had taken some “very helpful” steps, although it remained to be seen how effective these would be. Asked if Trump had a “red line” on North Korea, Spicer said the president did not believe these worked.  Susan Thornton, acting U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asia, said Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and China’s top diplomat, State Councilor Yang Jiechi, agreed in a phone call on Sunday on the need for strict enforcement of U.N. resolutions and for international action to press Pyongyang “to cease provocative actions and recommit to peaceful denuclearization.” Thornton said any new North Korean nuclear test “would draw a pretty significant international response.” “We’re definitely not seeking conflict or regime change,” she said. “But we are committed to defending our people and our allies should it be necessary.” Pence is expected to discuss Korean tensions with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday when he travels to Tokyo for economic talks with Finance Minister Taro Aso. He will also visit Jakarta and Sydney. His economic discussions will be closely watched to see how hard a line Washington is prepared to take on trade. Trump campaigned on an “America First” platform, and has vowed to narrow big trade deficits with nations like China and Japan. But Trump has also shown willingness to link trade to other issues, saying he would cut a better trade deal with China if it exerts influence on North Korea. China has appeared increasingly frustrated with Pyongyang, speaking out against its weapons tests and supporting United Nations sanctions, while repeatedly calling for talks. China banned imports of North Korean coal, the country’s most important export, in February, and Chinese media have raised the possibility of restricting oil shipments to the North. However, Beijing says the crisis is one between the United States and North Korea.  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said the situation was “highly sensitive, complicated and high risk” and all sides should “avoid taking provocative actions “ ",real

'Made in Syria': Refugees in Germany drive exports from home,"HAMBURG (Reuters) - Many Syrian refugees in Germany have resigned themselves to the reality that there will be no swift return to the land of their birth, where a civil war is nearing the start of its eighth year. They are starting to build new lives in their host country, driving up demand for  Made in Syria  goods there as they seek to soothe homesickness with a precious slice of their old lives. Products popular among the half a million Syrians, who mainly arrived over the last three years, range from nuts, sweets and sesame paste to clothes, vertical spinning grillers used to make shawarma meat in diners and hair removal wax.  People want the very same things they were used to in Syria,  said trader Anas Msouty, sitting in his dim underground office near Hamburg Port as workers sorted out parcels of baklawa sweets and clothes that had just arrived from Syria.  The German market is full of similar products from Turkey, but Syrians want Syrian (goods),  added the father-of-six, who had to abandon his Islamic women s clothing factory outside Damascus when he fled the country. Orders have grown 25-fold since Msouty set up his trading firm Sajeda three months after his arrival in Germany in early 2016. He now imports 25 tonnes of Syrian goods a month. He is not alone in capitalizing on this trend; dozens of Syrian restaurants, stores and supermarkets have sprung up in all major German cities over the past two years, with more opening every month. In Berlin alone, at least half a dozen new Syrian eateries and as many supermarkets have opened this year.  The rise in demand for Syrian goods is contributing to a gradual revival in Syrian exports to Germany, which has taken in more Syrian refugees than any other Western nation. Exports from Syria rose to 15.5 million euros ($17.9 million) in 2016 and totaled 8 million euros in the first five months of this year alone, according to official German data. This is still a far cry from the pre-war level when non-oil Syrian exports to Germany totaled around $100 million a year. More than 5 million Syrians - almost a quarter of the pre-war population - have fled the Middle Eastern nation, according to the United Nations. It is unclear how much support rising demand for Syrian goods among refugee populations in Germany and elsewhere may be having on Syria s shattered economy. Little data is available from the war zone. The revival in trade in Germany nonetheless appears to have coincided with a bottoming out of economic activity in Syria.  The World Bank estimates the country s gross domestic product contracted by an accumulated 61 percent in 2011-2015, but in 2016 it shrunk by only 2 percent, though it mainly puts the improvement down to a slowing in the population exodus. Msouty, who supplies Syrian individuals and businesses in Germany, said he was proud of his contribution to recovering Syrian exports, which he said is providing much-needed income to factory owners and workers in Syria.  We are resuscitating the Syrian economy,  he said.  In Berlin, the boulevard of Sonnenallee - dubbed  Arab Street  for its abundance of Arabic shop signs - has become one of the most popular shopping destinations and hangouts for the capital s Syrian refugees. It boasts three Syrian supermarkets, two Syrian restaurants and one Syrian sweet shop, which have all opened over the past two years.  This is just a smell of home,  said Houda Bayyad, a veiled young mother shopping at one of the supermarkets, which opened in recent weeks.  It doesn t solve our problems like learning German and finding a job. But it makes our life here easier,  said the 20-year-old, holding a jar of Makdous, a Syrian delicacy of baby aubergines stuffed with walnuts, garlic and sun-dried red peppers pickled in olive oil.  Most Syrian goods come from factories in areas under government control mainly in and around Damascus but also from Aleppo. Three companies in Damascus that supply Msouty with goods declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. The products are transported in trucks through relatively safe areas under government control to the port of Latakia in northern Syria and loaded onto container ships bound for Hamburg. Other products come by plane via Beirut. This trade is proving indispensable for Syrians setting up  businesses in Germany.  Sweet shops, and coffee and nut roasters, need specialized machines to make sweet and salty delights such as baklawa and roasted kernels. They prefer to import equipment from Syria as it is cheaper than to buy them in Germany from European or Turkish manufacturers. Restaurateurs depend on specialty raw ingredients to recreate the flavors that Syrians crave. L Amira Falafel, a Syrian restaurant in Hamburg that opened in 2015, has proved so popular that it has now opened at a second location in the northern city.   Our main goal was to make sure that everything we prepare tastes like in Syria,  said Mohammad Abou Saeed, co-owner of the eateries where it is hard to find a table any time of the day.  To do that we needed the same sesame paste, pickles and spices we used in Syria,  he added, gesturing at a waiter to bring baked bread to a couple who had just walked in.   It makes us very happy when diners tell us our food reminds them of Syria.   ",real
"Pakistani Taliban suicide bomber rams police truck, kills seven","QUETTA, Pakistan (Reuters) - A Pakistani Taliban suicide bomber rammed a car into a police truck in the southwestern city of Quetta on Wednesday, killing at least seven people, police said. The attack killed five police officials and two passers-by on the outskirts of the city of Quetta, police chief Abdur Razzaq Cheema said. He said 22 people were wounded, eight of them critically. Sarfraz Bugti, the home minister of Baluchistan province, of which Quetta is capital, told Reuters:  It was a suicide blast.   Quetta is about 100 km (60 miles) east of the border with Afghanistan. Bugti said the truck carrying the police officials was on its way to the city to drop them at their posts when the suicide bomber rammed into the vehicle. Television pictures showed the burnt wreckage of the vehicles.  The Pakistani Taliban, an umbrella organisation of various militant groups within Pakistan, and loosely allied to the Afghan Taliban, issued a statement claiming responsibility. Baluchistan province has long been the scene of an insurgency by separatists fighting against the state to demand more of a share of the gas- and mineral-rich region s resources. They also accuse the central government of discrimination.  The Taliban, Sunni Islam militants and sectarian groups linked to al Qaeda and the Islamic State group also operate in the strategically important region, which borders Iran as well as Afghanistan. The violence has fuelled concern about security for projects in the $57 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor, a transport and energy link planned to run from western China to Pakistan s southern deep-water port of Gwadar. A suicide bombing claimed by Islamic State at a Sufi Muslim shrine this month killed 22 people and wounded more than 30. Ayub Qureshi, the provincial police chief, said a counter-terrorism police officer was shot and killed in another part of Quetta as authorities were dealing with the suicide bombing.  A militant sectarian faction, the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi al-Almi, claimed responsibility for killing the counter-terrorism official, and for planting a roadside bomb in a northwestern region, that killed two soldiers. Security officials said a remote-controlled bomb was set off as an army vehicle passed by.      ",real

Trump pushes U.S. labor board toward Republican control,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he had picked an employment lawyer who has represented companies and business groups for a vacancy on the National Labor Relations Board. The selection of William Emanuel, 75, to fill one of the two vacancies at the agency brings it closer to having a Republican majority, which is expected to undo a series of recent decisions seen as favoring unions. The five-member NLRB oversees union elections and disputes between workers, unions, and employers.  Emanuel, a Los Angeles-based partner at law firm Littler Mendelson, has worked with Republicans in Congress and major trade groups from an array of industries, and has for decades defended employers in cases before the board. He is a member of the conservative Federalist Society, an influential group of lawyers credited with pushing Trump to nominate U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch to the high court. Emanuel said in a statement that it is an honor to be nominated. Industry groups such as the National Retail Federation and the National Restaurant Association hailed Emanuel’s nomination, saying he would help repair damage done to businesses by rulings from the NLRB during the Barack Obama administration. Trump last week said he intended to nominate fellow Republican Marvin Kaplan, a lawyer with the federal Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, to another vacancy on the board.  The positions require confirmation by the U.S. Senate.  The NLRB has been controlled by Democrats for nearly a decade and they currently have a 2-1 majority. When it has no vacancies, the board typically includes three members from the president’s party and two from the opposing party. Under Trump, lawyers and business groups expect the board to roll back a series of policy changes adopted during the administration of former President Barack Obama. They include rules designed to speed the union election process and a 2015 decision that made it easier for companies to be held liable for legal violations by contractors, staffing agencies, and franchisees. It was not clear when the Senate could vote on Trump’s nominees but several lawyers and other experts said the process could stretch into the fall. Kaplan previously worked for Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives crafting employment-related legislation. ",real
U.S. Republicans quibble over effective date of Obamacare repeal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican senators are leaning towards a plan to delay the effective date of an Obamacare repeal for three years, a senior Republican said on Wednesday. But some conservatives in the House of Representatives think that is too long to wait for the end of the Affordable Care Act, as President Barack Obama’s signature health insurance program is known. “In the Senate, there’s consensus for three years,” Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman of the chamber’s finance committee, told reporters, saying it could take that long to work out a replacement for Obamacare. “It takes time to do things around here.” Republicans in both the House and Senate say they want to repeal Obamacare early in 2017; it will be the first order of business in the Senate in January, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said on Tuesday. Donald Trump’s election as U.S. president last month means Republicans will control the White House, Senate and House of Representatives in 2017. The new Congress goes to work on Jan. 3; Trump will be sworn in on Jan. 20. But Republicans have not agreed on how quickly the Obamacare repeal should go into effect. A delay would give them time to work on a replacement, instead of throwing millions of Americans out of their health insurance with no substitute. Some House conservatives favor phasing out Obamacare and getting a replacement within two years, because three years would not lapse until after the next congressional election, with the attendant uncertainty about who will be in the majority then. “We don’t think it’s very wise to leave a long-term plan like that up to a (future) Congress that you can’t necessarily control,” said Ben Williamson, spokesman for Representative Mark Meadows, the incoming leader of the Freedom Caucus, a group of about 40 House conservatives. “There is a potential that some members of the Freedom Caucus might vote against repeal, if the replacement was going beyond two years,” Williamson said. The Affordable Care Act has provided some 25 million previously uninsured Americans with health coverage. Republicans have repeatedly tried to dismantle the law, which they call a government overreach. Another senior senator said some Republicans are worried about whether they will have to raise taxes in three years to pay for an Obamacare replacement, which could for example involve tax credits to subsidize health insurance. “What Republicans could be faced with in three years, is voting for a tax increase ... and that’s not exactly a place that Republicans relish being,” said Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee.

Senator McCain says Putin bigger threat than ISIS,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - U.S. Senator John McCain said Russian President Vladimir Putin is a bigger threat to global security than ISIS, and warned that the Senate would push for sanctions against Moscow for its alleged interference in the U.S. election. McCain, a leading foreign policy voice in the U.S. Congress, was speaking in an interview in Australia, where he has held security talks on his way to a defense summit in Singapore. “I think he (Putin) is the premier and most important threat, more so than ISIS,” McCain said in an interview on Australian Broadcasting Corp television. He said while there was no evidence the Russians succeeded in changing the U.S. election outcome, they were still trying to change elections, including the recent French vote. “I view the Russians as the far greatest challenge that we have,” said McCain, who is chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee. “So we need to have increased sanctions and hopefully when we come back from our recess, the Senate will move forward with sanctions on Russia and enact other penalties for Russian behavior.” McCain, who has been a critic of President Donald Trump, said he believes the national security team around Trump is developing a strategy that will lead to “victory” in Afghanistan, and Trump has great confidence in that team. “I do believe that most of the time that he accepts their advice and counsel. Can I tell you that he does all the time? No. And yes, does it bothers me? Yes, it bothers me,” he said. ",real
China tells U.S. not to be a 'human rights judge' after sanctions on Chinese official,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Friday urged the United States not to set itself up as a  human rights judge  and denounced the U.S. Treasury Department for punishing a Chinese public security official for alleged rights abuses.  Gao Yan was one of the targets of an executive order issued by U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday blocking the property of foreigners involved in human rights abuses. Gao had been in charge at Chaoyang Detention Centre in Beijing where a Chinese rights activist, Cao Shunli, was held and questioned prior to her death in hospital under police custody in March 2014. Rights groups say Cao was tortured and denied medical care. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular briefing that China opposed the United States using sanctions to target other countries  citizens based on their own domestic laws.  We urge the United States to impartially and objectively look upon China s human rights development and to stop acting as a so-called human rights judge,  she said, adding that China s police maintain public security in accordance with law. The head of the Russian republic of Chechnya and four other Russians and Chechens were also included on the list of individuals to be targeted under the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 law which freezes the bank accounts of those targeted. Hong Kong-based group Chinese Human Rights Defenders said in a statement that they welcomed Gao being named, but that they regretted the inclusion of only a low-level Chinese official, calling for Fu Zhenghua, a deputy minister of public security, to also be included.  Other higher-level police officials, who had  command responsibility  for Cao Shunli s death in custody and for other incidents of torture and human rights violations, including arbitrary detention, continue to enjoy impunity,  they said. Beijing regularly rejects foreign criticism of its human rights record saying that its people are best placed to judge the rights situation in China and that the country is governed by law. President Xi Jinping has presided over a crackdown on rights activists and lawyers that has seen hundreds detained or jailed since 2015 in what advocacy groups have called an unprecedented attack on human rights in China.

U.S. Defense Dept needs to better manage its finances: GAO,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Defense Department needs to better manage its finances if it hopes to rebuild and modernize the U.S. Armed Forces, the Government Accountability Office said in a report released on Tuesday. The Pentagon needs to give its decision makers and weapons buyers more accurate budget and cost information so they can make better decisions as they modernize weapons systems, the report said.  U.S. President Donald Trump’s $4.1 trillion fiscal 2018 budget proposal included $603 billion in defense spending for the Department of Defense as well as nuclear weapons programs at the Department of Energy and other national defense priorities. The GAO report comes as U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis presented lawmakers in the House and Senate with a $33 billion wish list of unfunded military needs. The report said despite increased defense funding under Trump, efforts “underway to rebuild readiness for portions of their military forces” are at risk without more comprehensive planning efforts at the Pentagon.  The federal agency, which oversees government resources, also said the Defense Department could police global hot spots with less expensive and more numerous regular troops instead of U.S. special forces.  “DOD has not taken steps to examine whether additional opportunities exist to reduce the high demand on these (special) forces by sharing some of their responsibilities with conventional forces,” the report said.  U.S. President Donald Trump’s fiscal 2018 budget proposal gave the military a modest boost to their budget, 3 percent more than what former President Barack Obama had sought in his long-term budget plan. The $574.5 billion for the Department of Defense would go to warfighting readiness and critical program requirements.  GAO said it has made approximately 3,100 recommendations to DOD since 2006. Of these about 1,037 have not been acted on, including 78 priority recommendations. The report released on Tuesday made no new recommendations. ",real

U.S. top court won't revive New Hampshire ballot 'selfie' ban,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected New Hampshire’s bid to revive a state law barring voters from taking “selfie” photos with their ballots during elections that a lower court struck down as a violation of free speech rights. New Hampshire banned such selfies in 2014, saying the photos could set the stage for a return of the kind of vote-buying or voter intimidation that was rampant in the 19th century.  The Supreme Court declined to hear the state’s appeal of a ruling by the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last September that the law ran afoul of the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment, which guarantees free speech. The state cannot curtail speech based on a hypothetical danger, the appeals court stated. Ballot selfies have become a popular way for voters to show support for favored candidates through postings on social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat.  Three New Hampshire residents who were under investigation for violating the law, including a man who wrote in the name of his dog to express dismay at his choices in the 2014 Republican primary for the U.S. Senate, sued the state that year claiming the measure violated the First Amendment. The 1st Circuit agreed last year, noting that New Hampshire had no complaints of vote-buying or evidence that people were being coerced to vote a certain way. New Hampshire’s secretary of state, William Gardner, appealed to the Supreme Court, noting that 18 states had laws that in some form prevented voters from displaying their ballots.  Digital photography and social media could allow an invasion of the sanctity of the voting booth and “eliminate the anonymity of the secret ballot,” Gardner said. “With recent advances in technology, one’s right to vote freely without fear of retaliation is in jeopardy,” Gardner added. Some states, including nearby Rhode Island, have passed laws explicitly allowing ballot selfies, reasoning in part that the trend has helped younger voters show their enthusiasm for the democratic process.

Mattis to review if military accidents linked to budget caps,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Monday that he was working to see if there was a link between a spate of recent military accidents and budget caps, but said he could not draw a direct line at this time.  Since June, more than 70 U.S. service members have either been killed or injured in training or non-combat accidents, ranging from two naval collisions in Asia to a Marine Corps transport plane crash in rural Mississippi. “I am not willing to say right now that there is a direct line between sequestration and what has happened. I am willing to say ... we are going to take a very close look at that,” Mattis told reporters. Mattis said that he was looking at a number of broader issues to try and explain the large number of accidents, including whether there were cultural issues in the military. “We are almost hardwired to say “can do,” that is just the way we are brought up,” Mattis said. “But there comes a point in peacetime where you have to make certain you are not always saying we’re going to do more with less,” he added. Mattis said he was not concerned that military leaders felt pressured to say their troops were trained and ready, even if they were not.  The issue of U.S. military accidents was highlighted by a series of recent naval collisions.  A pre-dawn collision between guided-missile destroyer John S. McCain and a merchant vessel east of Singapore and Malaysia on Aug. 21 killed 10 sailors and was the fourth major incident in the U.S. Pacific Fleet this year. In June, another destroyer, the Fitzgerald, collided with a Philippine cargo ship, killing seven U.S. sailors. The secretary of the Navy and the chief of naval operations will appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday, where they are expected to face tough questions from lawmakers on the collisions and whether enough was done to avoid them. In a Sunday interview on CBS’ “Face the Nation” Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said recent military accidents were because of budget caps. “It’s because of a thing called sequestration, and our failure over the last eight years to make sure our military is prepared, equipped, trained,” McCain said.

Greek archaeologists clear way for Hellenikon resort,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece welcomed a decision by senior archaeologists to conditionally permit a major tourism project in Athens on Wednesday, saying it cleared the way for the country to turn the site into one of Europe’s biggest coastal resorts. The 8 billion euro ($9.4 billion) project to develop the disused Hellenikon airport site is a key term of Greece’s international bailout and is closely watched by its official creditors and potential investors in the crisis-hit country. Greek developer Lamda signed a 99-year lease with the state in 2014 for the 620-hectare (1,530-acre) area, once the site of Athens airport. But the project has faced delays, partly over a long-running row between developers and those who fear it will damage the environment and cultural heritage. After three inconclusive meetings in recent weeks, the Central Archaeological Council, an advisory body, recommended on Tuesday that about 30 hectares (74 acres) of the 620-hectare plot under the project be declared an archaeological site. “The decision is fine,” Deputy Economy Minister in charge of investments, Stergios Pitsiorlas, told Reuters. “The fact that a small area is declared of archaeological interest shields the whole process from future litigation.” Pitsiorlas said the recommendation meant that archaeologists will have a closer supervision of construction work. Backed by Chinese and Gulf funds, Lamda submitted its detailed development plan for Hellenikon in July, setting off a licensing process which will wrap up with a decree. The Council approved the plan on Tuesday and designated specific areas where construction should not be allowed. It was not immediately clear how the Council’s recommendation could affect Lamda’s construction plan. Lamda said it was waiting to be officially notified over the decision before making any public statement, noting that “the importance of the archaeological findings has been included from the beginning in the company’s undertakings”. It said it should be able to assess the impact of the Council’s decision on its development plan once it has reviewed the resolutions and accompanying diagrams. The recommendation is not binding, however, the culture ministry always respects the body’s decisions. Greece on Monday overcame another hurdle to the project by winning an appeal over objections by forestry officials. Hellenikon has become a major political issue in Greece, which is slowly emerging from a multi-year debt crisis.  Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, whose leftist party strongly opposed it before coming to power in 2015, is now seen as keen to implement the deal to help boost economic activity and reduce unemployment, the euro zone’s highest.  Referring to the council’s decision, Deputy Foreign Minister Giannis Amanatidis said it was “a complicated process which was resolved in the best possible way”. ",real
Moderate Republicans warn of trouble for tax reform,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Twenty moderate Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives warned on Friday that efforts to overhaul the federal tax code could be jeopardized by demands for including major spending cuts in a fiscal 2018 budget resolution. In a June 30 letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan, lawmakers from the moderate Tuesday Group said that including hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to mandatory programs could be “extremely problematic” for tax reform and asked for a budget delay until Senate Republicans finish their debate on healthcare legislation. “We fear that if the House persists on pursuing this course, it could imperil tax reform,” wrote the lawmakers, who were led by Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania. Republicans must pass a 2018 budget resolution to unlock a key legislative tool known as reconciliation, which the party needs to move a tax bill forward without support from Democrats.  But members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus say they will back a spending plan only if it cuts mandatory programs including Medicaid and food stamps, reductions that moderates oppose. “House Republicans have made significant progress on budget decisions and these family discussions will continue amongst the conference,” Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said in a statement. The Freedom Caucus and Tuesday Group each represents enough House Republicans to stymie legislation on its own.  Outside organizations including powerful business lobby groups are increasingly worried that the disagreement could lead to a political stand-off that prevents tax reform from occurring. “No other reforms under consideration rise to the importance of pro-growth, comprehensive tax reform,” the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, the National Association of Manufacturers and the National Federation of Independent Business said in a joint letter to Republican and Democratic congressional leaders on Wednesday. Republican moderates also worry that adding mandatory cuts to a reconciliation bill would create unpalatable legislation that reduces benefits for the poor while granting tax cuts to corporations and wealthy individuals, according to aides.  The House Budget Committee canceled plans to send a resolution for fiscal 2018 to the floor this week, after the chairmen of several other committees rejected efforts to wring $250 billion in mandatory spending from spending. Freedom Caucus members want much larger cuts.  ",real
Trump and Japan's Abe agree to keep pressure on North Korea,"TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed in a telephone conversation on Wednesday that pressure should be maintained on North Korea, a senior Japanese government official told reporters.

In recent weeks North Korea has launched two missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test, and may be fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said last weekend that Washington was directly communicating with Pyongyang on its nuclear and missile programs but that Pyongyang had shown no interest in dialogue. Trump later dismissed any prospect of talks with North Korea as a waste of time.     During the 12-minute telephone conversation, Abe also offered condolences over the mass shooting in Las Vegas, and told Trump that Japan was  100 percent  behind the American people. Trump will be traveling to Japan, China, South Korea, Vietnam and the Philippines next month. ",real
Indonesia to bar Myanmar protest at world's biggest Buddhist temple,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian police have pledged to bar Islamist groups from staging a rally on Friday at the Borobudur Buddhist temple in central Java to protest against the persecution of Myanmar s Rohingya Muslims. Islamist groups say they plan the demonstration close to the stupa-topped Borobudur temple, which dates from the 9th century and is a popular tourist site, to call for an end to violence against the religious and ethnic minority in Myanmar.  Indonesia has the world s largest population of Muslims and there have been a number of anti-Myanmar protests in Jakarta and the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur over the treatment of Buddhist-majority Myanmar s roughly 1.1 million Rohingyas.  Almost 125,000 Rohingyas have been forced to flee clashes between Rohingya insurgents and the army in the northwest Rakhine state. Tens of thousands have crossed the border into neighboring Bangladesh.  The action at Borobudur temple will be prohibited,  National Police Chief Tito Karnavian told reporters, according to media.   This is not just part of the heritage of Indonesia, but that of the world. There is no need for protests in response to the Rohingya conflict because the Indonesian government is taking action on it already.  Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi on Monday met  Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi and top security officials to call for a halt to the bloodshed. Marsudi was due in Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, on Tuesday. Pakistani Foreign Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif expressed  deep anguish at the ongoing violence against the Rohingya Muslims  and urged the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to take  immediate and effective action to bring an end to all human-rights violations against innocent and unarmed Rohingya Muslim population . An organizer of Friday s planned protest said the groups wanted to protest peacefully near the Borobodur temple to show Indonesia s tolerance.

Threatening note left at senator's office amid healthcare debate,"(Reuters) - A threatening note was left over the weekend at the Las Vegas office of a Republican U.S. senator from Nevada who may cast a decisive vote over a healthcare bill aimed at dismantling Obamacare, police said on Monday. Officers who responded to a burglary alarm at the building housing Senator Dean Heller’s office found the note near the office door on Sunday morning, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said in a statement. The content of the note was not released and police are investigating. The alarm was triggered by motion sensors and there was no forced entry to the building or Heller’s office, spokesman Officer Larry Hadfield said by phone. Heller, who is up for re-election next year, is under pressure over his potential vote on the revised bill before the Senate that would roll back the 2010 Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature domestic accomplishment, popularly known as Obamacare. Heller is among a dozen Republican senators who have expressed reservations or remained noncommittal about the revised bill. Republicans control the Senate by a 52-48 margin and cannot afford to lose more than two from within their ranks because of united Democratic opposition. Two Republicans have already said they oppose it. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has delayed a vote on a retooled bill.  Heller’s office declined to comment on the letter, citing an ongoing investigation. ",real
"Senate passes bill to bolster power grid, speed LNG exports","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Senate passed the first broad energy bill in nine years on Wednesday, legislation containing modest measures popular with both Republicans and Democrats to modernize the power grid and speed the permitting process for liquefied natural gas exports.  The bill, which passed 85-12, attempts to protect the power grid from extreme weather events such as ice storms and hurricanes, and from cyber attacks. It also aims to spur innovations in storage of power from wind and solar energy. The House of Representatives passed a similar bill last year. The Energy Policy and Modernization Act would increase U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG), eventually helping to give European consumers alternatives to relying mainly on Russia for gas.    After disagreements held the bill up for months, senators last week dropped measures from the bill to aid Flint, Michigan overcome a drinking water crisis, in which children have been exposed to dangerous levels of lead, and on offshore drilling.   Lawmakers from both the House and Senate will next iron out differences over the bill. The Senate bill, for instance, requires the Department of Energy to issue a decision on LNG projects within 45 days of an environmental assessment, while the House bill directs the DOE to make the decision on permits after 30 days. Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington state who co-sponsored the bill, said shortly before it passed that she hoped the chambers would move quickly “so that we can realize the opportunity to help our businesses and consumers plan for the energy future.”  The White House has signaled that President Barack Obama would sign the Senate bill.  Energy policy analyst Kevin Book of ClearView Energy Partners said the chances the bill would be signed into law this year were about 65 percent, because the White House has had some differences with the House bill.  Charlie Riedl, the head of industry group the Center for Liquefied Natural Gas, said the vote was a “big step forward” and that certainty about the regulatory process is “crucial” for projects that cost billions of dollars to build.  Rob Cowin, director of government affairs at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit group, said the bill falls “far short” of what is needed to promote wind and solar power, but is “better than doing nothing.” The Senate on Tuesday passed several amendments to the bill, including restricting most sales from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve when oil prices are low.

"U.S. retaliates against Russia, orders closure of consulate, annexes","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has told Russia to close its consulate in San Francisco and buildings in Washington and New York that house trade missions, the State Department said on Thursday, in retaliation for Moscow cutting the U.S. diplomatic presence in Russia. The announcement was the latest in tit-for-tat measures between the two countries that have helped to drive relations to a new post-Cold War low, thwarting hopes on both sides that they might improve after U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January. Last month, Moscow ordered the United States to cut its diplomatic and technical staff in Russia by more than half, to 455 people to match the number of Russian diplomats in the United States, after Congress overwhelmingly approved new sanctions against Russia. The sanctions were imposed in response to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and to punish Russia further for its 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. “We believe this action was unwarranted and detrimental to the overall relationship between our countries,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement on Thursday, adding that the United States had completed the reduction. “In the spirit of parity invoked by the Russians,” Nauert said, the United States has required the Russian government to close its San Francisco consulate and two annexes in Washington, D.C. and New York by Sept. 2. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the decision. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson informed Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov of the closures in a phone call on Thursday, a senior Trump administration official said. The two men plan to meet on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in September, the official said. Lavrov expressed regret about Washington’s decision during the phone call with Tillerson, his ministry said. “Moscow will closely study the new measures announced by the Americans, after which our reaction will be conveyed,” the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement. The latest U.S. move caps eight months of back-and-forth retaliatory measures between the two countries spanning two U.S. administrations. In December, the administration of Barack Obama closed two Russian countryside vacation retreats in Maryland and New York, saying the compounds had been used for intelligence-related purposes. The closures were part of a broader response, including the expulsion of 35 suspected Russian spies, to what U.S. officials have called cyber interference by Moscow in the 2016 elections. The Kremlin has denied the allegations. Trump came into office wanting to improve relations with Russia, a desire that was hamstrung by the election interference allegations. The new sanctions passed by Congress conflicted with Trump’s goals, but he grudgingly signed them into law this month. The United States said last week that it would have to sharply scale back visa services in Russia, a move that will hit Russian business travelers, tourists and students. The Russian consulate in San Francisco handles work from seven states in the Western United States. There are three other Russian consulates separate from the embassy in Washington. They are in New York, Seattle and Houston. The consulate in San Francisco is the oldest and most established of Russia’s consulates in the United States, the senior Trump administration official told reporters. An official residence at the consulate will also be closed. No Russian diplomats are being expelled, and the diplomats assigned to San Francisco can be re-assigned to other posts in the United States, the official said. The Russians can continue to retain ownership of any of the closed facilities, or sell them, but will not be allowed to carry out diplomatic activities there, the official said. “Even after these closures, Russia will still maintain more diplomatic and consular annexes in the United States than we have in Russia,” the official said. “We’ve chosen to allow the Russian government to maintain some of its annexes in an effort to arrest the downward spiral in our relationship.” ",real

Israel's Sara Netanyahu may face indictment: attorney general,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel s attorney general is considering indicting the wife of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Sara, on suspicion of using state funds for personal dining and catering services amounting to some $100,000, the justice ministry said on Friday. The ministry statement said the attorney general was considering prosecuting Sara Netanyahu for offences that include fraudulently procuring items, fraud and breach of trust. A post on the prime minister s Facebook page published late on Thursday in response to media reports about a forthcoming announcement by Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, said the claims against Sara Netanyahu were  absurd and will be proven to be unfounded . It was unclear what political impact Friday s announcement might have on Netanyahu, who himself is under investigation in two corruption cases.  One of those, known as Case 1000, involves gifts that the prime minister and his family may have received from businessmen, while Case 2000 deals with alleged efforts by him to secure better coverage from an Israeli newspaper publisher. Netanyahu - who has been prime minister for 11 years over four terms - has denied any wrongdoing.  Netanyahu leads a relatively stable coalition government and presides over a buoyant economy. His conservative Likud party has rallied behind him in the absence of clear rivals for the leadership, rebuffing calls for his departure from the center-left opposition. Likud s religious-nationalist coalition partners, seeing no threat to their agenda with Netanyahu as prime minister, are likewise sticking with him for now. In a case dubbed  the meals-ordering affair  by the Justice Ministry, Sara Netanyahu with help from an aide allegedly created a false impression between 2010-2013 that no cooks were employed at the prime minister s official residence, while indeed there were, according to the ministry statement. This was done, the statement said, to procure state funding for outside catering that would have been covered had there been no chef.  In this way, hundreds of meals from restaurants and chefs worth 359,000 shekels ($102,399) were received from the state fraudulently,  said the justice ministry statement. Sara Netanyahu has the option to plead her case in a hearing with the attorney general. ",real

North Korea's Kim congratulates China's Xi after congress,"SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un sent a rare congratulatory message to Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday at the end of China s Communist Party Congress, wishing him  great success  as head of the nation, the North s state media said. The friendly gesture by the North Korean leader, who seldom issues personal messages, comes as China is being urged by the international community to do more to rein in the North s missile and nuclear tests that have raised tensions globally. Xi became China s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong at the all-important week-long congress.  It expressed the conviction that the relations between the two parties and the two countries would develop in the interests of the peoples of the two countries,  the North s state-run central news agency said in a statement on Thursday, citing the message sent by Kim to Xi.  The Chinese people have entered the road of building socialism with the Chinese characteristics in the new era  under the guidance of Xi, the message said. The two countries often exchange routine diplomatic correspondence and ceremonial letters to each other on political anniversaries or political promotions, although personal messages to and from the leaders tend to be few. Analysts said it was too early to tell whether or not ties between the two countries were warming up.  Congratulatory messages between North Korea and China are an old story and reading too much into the message exchanged would be a one-sided analysis,  said Yang Moo-jin, professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul.   It s what they usually do and not surprising at all.  China is the North s sole major ally, and accounts for more than 90 percent of trade with the isolated country.  Beijing has been called upon by several countries, especially the United States, to step up its efforts to curb North Korea s ambitions towards building a nuclear-tipped ballistic missile that can reach the United States. It has shown it is irritated with Pyongyang following the isolated state s numerous missile launches and nuclear tests, repeatedly calling for restraint and urging all sides to speak and act carefully. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular briefing on Thursday that China had received  congratulatory messages from many countries and parties, including one from North Korea.  China and North Korea are close neighbors and have a tradition of friendly contact,  he said, without elaborating.  China has said it will strictly enforce U.N. Security Council sanctions banning imports of North Korean coal, textiles and seafood, while cutting off oil shipments to the North. North Korea has not engaged in any missile or nuclear provocations since mid-September, although it tends to test fewer missiles late in the year for unexplained reasons.  North Korea has been walking a diplomatic tightrope by taking advantage of strategic mistrust between China and Russia, but it has not been easy as Beijing has sternly responded to its nuclear and missile provocations,  said Kim Han-kwon, a professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy in Seoul.   China s party congress is over, but Kim Jong Un s concerns will only continue to deepen. The most significant event at hand is the upcoming summit between Xi and (U.S. President Donald) Trump,  said Kim. ",real

U.S. environmental agency chief says humans contribute to global warming,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, said on Friday he believes human activity plays a role in global warming, but measuring that contribution with precision is difficult.

Measuring with precision, from my perspective, the degree of human contribution is very challenging.” ",real
White House meeting on Paris climate deal postponed: official,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A White House meeting that was to help determine whether the United States should withdraw from the Paris climate accord has been postponed, an administration official said on Tuesday. Some of President Donald Trump’s top advisers, including Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt, were scheduled to meet on Tuesday to discuss how Trump should handle the 2015 climate deal. The meeting was canceled because “some of the principals are traveling today,” the White House official said. The meeting will be rescheduled, but no date has been set, the official said. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters on Air Force One as Trump was returning from a visit to Wisconsin that the meeting “could be as soon as tomorrow, but I know that they’re working on trying to find a time that works for everybody.” The accord, agreed on by nearly 200 countries in Paris in 2015 and ratified in 2016, aims to limit planetary warming in part by slashing carbon dioxide and other emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. Under the pact, the United States committed to reducing its emissions by 26 to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. Trump has said the United States should “cancel” the deal, but he has been mostly quiet on the issue since he was elected last November. The White House has said it would take a position on the agreement before a summit of the Group of Seven wealthy nations in late May. ",real
Egypt to launch building project in Sinai: Sisi,"CAIRO (Reuters) - President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said on Saturday Egypt will in the next two to three years embark on a $5.60 billion construction project in the Sinai peninsula whose north has been gripped by an Islamist insurgency.   While coast of the south of the peninsula is peppered with Red Sea tourist resorts, North Sinai province is underdeveloped and lacks basic infrastructure and job opportunities.  Security forces have battled Islamist militants in the mainly desert region, stretching from the Suez Canal eastwards to the Gaza Strip and Israel, since 2013. Militants have killed hundreds of police and soldiers.  Sisi ordered armed forces to end the insurgency within three months after an attack on a mosque in North Sinai last month killed more than 300 people. It was the worst militant attack in Egypt s modern history.  We have entrusted the ministry of housing and the engineering authority with a national project of comprehensive urban planning,  Sisi said at a ceremony to inaugurate a development project in the Suez Canal city of Ismailia.    The president said the project would cost 100 billion Egyptian pounds and that it would be carried out whether he remained in power or not.  He did not provide a start date, sources of funding or specific details of what would be built under the project.  ",real
